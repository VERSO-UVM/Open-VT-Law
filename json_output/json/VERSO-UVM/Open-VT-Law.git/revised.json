Penalty and enforcement  (a) A person who is a member of a public body and who knowingly and intentionally violates the provisions of this subchapter, a person who knowingly and intentionally violates the provisions of this subchapter on behalf or at the behest of a public body, or a person who knowingly and intentionally participates in the wrongful exclusion of any person or persons from any meeting subject to this subchapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $500.00.  (b)(1) Prior to instituting an action under subsection (c) of this section, the Attorney General or any person aggrieved by a violation of the provisions of this subchapter shall provide the public body written notice that alleges a specific violation of this subchapter and requests a specific cure of such violation. The public body will not be liable for attorney's fees and litigation costs under subsection (d) of this section if it cures in fact a violation of this subchapter in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.  (2) Upon receipt of the written notice of alleged violation, the public body shall respond publicly to the alleged violation within 10 calendar days by:  (A) acknowledging the violation of this subchapter and stating an intent to cure the violation within 14 calendar days; or  (B) stating that the public body has determined that no violation has occurred and that no cure is necessary.  (3) Failure of a public body to respond to a written notice of alleged violation within 10 calendar days shall be treated as a denial of the violation for purposes of enforcement of the requirements of this subchapter.  (4) Within 14 calendar days after a public body acknowledges a violation under subdivision (2)(A) of this subsection, the public body shall cure the violation at an open meeting by:  (A) either ratifying, or declaring as void, any action taken at or resulting from:  (i) a meeting that was not noticed in accordance with subsection 312(c) of this title; or  (ii) a meeting that a person or the public was wrongfully excluded from attending; or  (iii) an executive session or portion thereof not authorized under subdivisions 313(a)(1)-(10) of this title; and  (B) adopting specific measures that actually prevent future violations.  (c) Following an acknowledgment or denial of a violation and, if applicable, following expiration of the 14-calendar-day cure period for public bodies acknowledging a violation, the Attorney General or any person aggrieved by a violation of the provisions of this subchapter may bring an action in the Civil Division of the Superior Court in the county in which the violation has taken place for appropriate injunctive relief or for a declaratory judgment. An action may be brought under this section no later than one year after the meeting at which the alleged violation occurred or to which the alleged violation relates. Except as to cases the court considers of greater importance, proceedings before the Civil Division of the Superior Court, as authorized by this section and appeals therefrom, take precedence on the docket over all cases and shall be assigned for hearing and trial or for argument at the earliest practicable date and expedited in every way.  (d) The court shall assess against a public body found to have violated the requirements of this subchapter reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this subchapter in which the complainant has substantially prevailed, unless the court finds that:  (1)(A) the public body had a reasonable basis in fact and law for its position; and  (B) the public body acted in good faith. In determining whether a public body acted in good faith, the court shall consider, among other factors, whether the public body responded to a notice of an alleged violation of this subchapter in a timely manner under subsection (b) of this section; or  (2) the public body cured the violation in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.

      "Subchapter 3: Access To Public Records": "315. Statement of policy; short title  (a) It is the policy of this subchapter to provide for free and open examination of records consistent with Chapter I, Article 6 of the Vermont Constitution. Officers of government are trustees and servants of the people and it is in the public interest to enable any person to review and criticize their decisions even though such examination may cause inconvenience or embarrassment. All people, however, have a right to privacy in their personal and economic pursuits, which ought to be protected unless specific information is needed to review the action of a governmental officer. Consistent with these principles, the General Assembly hereby declares that certain public records shall be made available to any person as hereinafter provided. To that end, the provisions of this subchapter shall be liberally construed to implement this policy, and the burden of proof shall be on the public agency to sustain its action.  (b) The General Assembly finds that public records are essential to the administration of State and local government. Public records contain information that allows government programs to function, provides officials with a basis for making decisions, and ensures continuity with past operations. Public records document the legal responsibilities of government, help protect the rights of citizens, and provide citizens a means of monitoring government programs and measuring the performance of public officials. Public records provide documentation for the functioning of government and for the retrospective analysis of the development of Vermont government and the impact of programs on citizens.  (c) This subchapter may be known and cited as the Public Records Act or the PRA. (Added 1975, No. 231 (Adj. Sess.), 1; amended 2011, No. 59, 1; 2015, No. 29, 1; 2017, No. 166 (Adj. Sess.), 2.)  316. Access to public records and documents  (a) Any person may inspect or copy any public record of a public agency, as follows:  (1) For any agency, board, department, commission, committee, branch, instrumentality, or authority of the State, a person may inspect a public record on any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, between the hours of nine o'clock and 12 o'clock in the forenoon and between one o'clock and four o'clock in the afternoon.  (2) For any agency, board, committee, department, instrumentality, commission, or authority of a political subdivision of the State, a person may inspect a public record during customary business hours.  (b) If copying equipment maintained for use by a public agency is used by the agency to copy the public record or document requested, the agency may charge and collect from the person requesting the copy the actual cost of providing the copy. The agency may also charge and collect from the person making the request, the costs associated with mailing or transmitting the record by facsimile or other electronic means. Nothing in this section shall exempt any person from paying fees otherwise established by law for obtaining copies of public records or documents, but if such fee is established for the copy, no additional costs or fees shall be charged.  (c) Unless otherwise provided by law, in the following instances an agency may also charge and collect the cost of staff time associated with complying with a request for a copy of a public record: (1) the time directly involved in complying with the request exceeds 30 minutes; (2) the agency agrees to create a public record; or (3) the agency agrees to provide the public record in a nonstandard format and the time directly involved in complying with the request exceeds 30 minutes. The agency may require that requests subject to staff time charges under this subsection be made in writing and that all charges be paid, in whole or in part, prior to delivery of the copies. Upon request, the agency shall provide an estimate of the charge.  (d) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Secretary of Administration, shall establish the actual cost of providing a copy of a public record that may be charged by State agencies. The Secretary shall also establish the amount that may be charged for staff time, when such a charge is authorized under this section. To determine \"actual cost,\" the Secretary shall consider the following only: the cost of the paper or the electronic media onto which a public record is copied, a prorated amount for maintenance and replacement of the machine or equipment used to copy the record, and any utility charges directly associated with copying a record. The Secretary of State shall adopt, by rule, a uniform schedule of public record charges for State agencies.  (e) After public hearing, the legislative body of a political subdivision shall establish actual cost charges for copies of public records. The legislative body shall also establish the amount that may be charged for staff time, when such a charge is authorized under this section. To determine actual cost charges, the legislative body shall use the same factors used by the Secretary of State. If a legislative body fails to establish a uniform schedule of charges, the charges for that political subdivision shall be the uniform schedule of charges established by the Secretary of State until the local legislative body establishes such a schedule. A schedule of public records charges shall be posted in prominent locations in the town offices.  (f) State agencies shall provide receipts for all monies received under this section. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a State agency may retain monies collected under this section to the extent such charges represent the actual cost incurred to provide copies under this subchapter. Amounts collected by a State agency under this section for the cost of staff time associated with providing copies shall be deposited in the General Fund, unless another disposition or use of revenues received by that agency is specifically authorized by law. Charges collected under this section shall be deposited in the agency's operating account or the General Fund, as appropriate, on a monthly basis or whenever the amount totals $100.00, whichever occurs first.  (g) A public agency having the equipment necessary to copy its public records shall utilize its equipment to produce copies. If the public agency does not have such equipment, nothing in this section shall be construed to require the public agency to provide or arrange for copying service, to use or permit the use of copying equipment other than its own, to permit operation of its copying equipment by other than its own personnel, to permit removal of the public record by the requesting person for purposes of copying, or to make its own personnel available for making handwritten or typed copies of the public record or document requested.  (h) Standard formats for copies of public records shall be as follows: for copies in paper form, a photocopy of a paper public record or a hard copy print-out of a public record maintained in electronic form; for copies in electronic form, the format in which the record is maintained. Any format other than the formats described in this subsection is a nonstandard format.  (i) If an agency maintains public records in an electronic format, nonexempt public records shall be available for copying in either the standard electronic format or the standard paper format, as designated by the party requesting the records. An agency may, but is not required to, provide copies of public records in a nonstandard format, to create a public record, or to convert paper public records to electronic format.  (j) A public agency may make reasonable rules to prevent disruption of operations, to preserve the security of public records or documents, and to protect them from damage.  (k) Information concerning facilities and sites for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste shall be made available to the public under this subchapter in substantially the same manner and to the same degree as such information is made available under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, 42 U.S.C. chapter 82, subchapter 3, and the Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. section 552 et seq. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this subchapter and the cited federal laws, federal law shall govern. (Added 1975, No. 231 (Adj. Sess.), 1; amended 1987, No. 85, 5, eff. June 9, 1987; 1995, No. 159 (Adj. Sess.), 1; 2003, No. 158 (Adj. Sess.), 4; 2011, No. 59, 2.)  317.

Management of public records  (a)(1) Public records in general and archival records in particular should be systematically managed to provide ready access to vital information, to promote the efficient and economical operation of government, and to preserve their legal, administrative, and informational value.  (2) Any public agency may seek services from the Statewide Records and Information Management Program, as defined in 3 V.S.A. 117(b) and administered by the Vermont State Archives and Records Administration, to establish, maintain, and implement an active and continuing internal records and information management program for the agency.  (b) A custodian of public records shall not destroy, give away, sell, discard, or damage any record or records in his or her charge, unless specifically authorized by law or under a record schedule, as defined in 3 V.S.A. 117(a)(6), that has been approved by the State Archivist. (Added 2007, No. 96 (Adj. Sess.), 1; amended 2017, No. 100 (Adj. Sess.), 2.)  318. Procedure  (a)(1) As used in this section, \"promptly\" means immediately, with little or no delay, and, unless otherwise provided in this section, not more than three business days:  (A) from receipt of a request under this subchapter; or  (B) in the case of a reversal on appeal by a head of the agency pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, from the date of the determination on appeal.  (2) A custodian or head of the agency who fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this section shall be deemed to have denied the request or the appeal upon the expiration of the time limit.  (b) Upon request, the custodian of a public record shall promptly produce the record for inspection or a copy of the record, except that:  (1) If the record is in active use or in storage and therefore not available for use at the time the person asks to examine it, the custodian shall promptly certify this fact in writing to the applicant and, in the certification, set a date and hour within one calendar week of the request when the record will be available.  (2) If the custodian considers the record to be exempt from inspection and copying under the provisions of this subchapter, the custodian shall promptly so certify in writing. The certification shall:  (A) identify the records withheld;  (B) include the asserted statutory basis for denial and a brief statement of the reasons and supporting facts for denial;  (C) provide the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for denial of the request; and  (D) notify the person of his or her right to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination.  (3) [Repealed.]  (4) If a record does not exist, the custodian shall promptly certify in writing that the record does not exist under the name given to the custodian by the applicant or by any other name known to the custodian.  (5) In unusual circumstances as herein specified, the time limits prescribed in this section may be extended by written notice to the person making the request setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten business days from receipt of the request or, in the case of a reversal on appeal by a head of the agency pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, from the date of the determination on appeal. As used in this subdivision, \"unusual circumstances\" means to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request:  (A) the need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;  (B) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request; or  (C) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject matter interest therein, or with the Attorney General.  (c)(1) Any denial of access by the custodian of a public record may be appealed to the head of the agency. The head of the agency shall make a written determination on an appeal within five business days after the receipt of the appeal.  (2) If the head of the agency upholds the denial of a request for records, in whole or in part, the written determination shall include:  (A) the asserted statutory basis for upholding the denial;  (B) a brief statement of the reasons and supporting facts for upholding the denial; and  (C) notification of the provisions for judicial review of the determination under section 319 of this title.  (3) If the head of the agency reverses the denial of a request for records, the records shall be promptly made available to the person making the request.  (d) In responding to a request to inspect or copy a record under this subchapter, a public agency shall consult with the person making the request in order to clarify the request or to obtain additional information that will assist the public agency in responding to the request and, when authorized by this subchapter, in facilitating production of the requested record for inspection or copying. In unusual circumstances, as that term is defined in subdivision (b)(5) of this section, a public agency may request that a person seeking a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records narrow the scope of a public records request.  (e) A public agency shall not withhold any record in its entirety on the basis that it contains some exempt content if the record is otherwise subject to disclosure; instead, the public agency shall redact the information it considers to be exempt and produce the record accompanied by an explanation of the basis for denial of the redacted information.  (f) If a person making the request has a disability that requires accommodation to gain equal access to the public record sought, the person shall notify the public agency of the type of accommodation requested. The public agency shall give primary consideration to the accommodation choice expressed by the requestor, but may propose an alternative accommodation so long as it achieves equal access. The public agency shall provide accommodation to the person making the request unless the agency can demonstrate that accommodation would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its service, programs, activities, or in undue financial and administrative burden.  (g) The Secretary of State shall provide municipal public agencies and members of the public information and advice regarding the requirements of the Public Records Act and may utilize informational websites, toll-free telephone numbers, or other methods to provide such information and advice.  (h) The head of a State agency or department shall:  (1) designate the agency's or department's records officer described in 3 V.S.A. 218, or shall designate some other person, to be accountable for overseeing the processing of requests for public records received by the agency or department in accordance with this section; and  (2) post on the agency's or department's website the name and contact information of the person designated under subdivision (1) of this subsection.

April 30, 2019.)  318a. Executive Branch Agency Public Records Request System  (a) The Secretary of Administration shall maintain and update the Public Records Request System established pursuant to 2006 Acts and Resolves No. 132, Sec. 3 and 2011 Acts and Resolves No. 59, Sec. 13 with the information furnished under subsection (b) of this section and post System information on the website of the Agency of Administration.  (b) All public agencies of the Executive Branch of the State:  (1) that receive a written request to inspect or copy a record under this subchapter shall catalogue the request in the Public Records Request System established and maintained by the Secretary of Administration by furnishing the following information:  (A) the date the request was received;  (B) the agency that received the request;  (C) the person that made the request, including a contact name;  (D) the status of the request, including whether the request was fulfilled in whole, fulfilled in part, or denied;  (E) if the request was fulfilled in part or denied, the exemption or other grounds asserted as the basis for partial fulfillment or denial;  (F) the estimated hours necessary to respond to the request;  (G) the date the agency closed the request; and  (H) the elapsed time between receipt of the request and the date the agency closed the request; and  (2) shall post in a conspicuous location on their respective websites a link to the location on the Agency of Administration's website where Public Records Request System information is maintained. (Added 2017, No. 166 (Adj. Sess.), 6.)  319. Enforcement  (a) Any person aggrieved by the denial of a request for public records under this subchapter may apply to the Civil Division of the Superior Court in the county in which the complainant resides, or has his or her personal place of business, or in which the public records are situated, or in the Civil Division of the Superior Court of Washington County, to enjoin the public agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant. In such a case, the court shall determine the matter de novo, and may examine the contents of such agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in section 317 of this title, and the burden of proof shall be on the public agency to sustain its action.  (b) Except as to cases the court considers of greater importance, proceedings before the Civil Division of the Superior Court, as authorized by this section, and appeals there from, take precedence on the docket over all cases and shall be assigned for hearing and trial or for argument at the earliest practicable date and expedited in every way.  (c) If the public agency can show the court that exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the court may retain jurisdiction and allow the agency additional time to complete its review of the records.  (d)(1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court shall assess against the public agency reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.  (2) The court may, in its discretion, assess against a public agency reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in a case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed provided that the public agency, within the time allowed for service of an answer under V.R.C.P. 12(a)(1):  (A) concedes that a contested record or contested records are public; and  (B) provides the record or records to the complainant.  (3) The court may assess against the complainant reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section when the court finds that the complainant has violated V.R.C.P. 11. (Added 1975, No. 231 (Adj. Sess.), 1; amended 2011, No. 59, 5.)  320. Penalties  (a) Whenever the court orders the production of any public agency records, improperly withheld from the complainant and assesses against the agency reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs, and the court additionally issues a written finding that the circumstances surrounding the withholding raise questions whether the agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, the Department of Human Resources if applicable to that employee, shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the withholding. The Department, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted, shall submit its findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee or his or her representative. The administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Department recommends.  (b) In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the Civil Division of the Superior Court may punish for contempt the responsible employee or official, and in the case of a uniformed service, the responsible member.  (c) A person who willfully destroys, gives away, sells, discards, or damages a public record without having authority to do so shall be fined at least $50.00 but not more than $1,000.00 for each offense.

    "Chapter 23: Native American Indian People": {
      "null": "851. Findings  The General Assembly finds that:  (1) At least 1,700 Vermonters claim to be direct descendants of the several indigenous Native American peoples, now known as Western Abenaki tribes, who originally inhabited all of Vermont and New Hampshire, parts of western Maine, parts of southern Quebec, and parts of upstate New York for hundreds of years, beginning long before the arrival of Europeans.  (2) There is ample archaeological evidence that demonstrates that the Missisquoi and Cowasuck Abenaki were indigenous to and farmed the river floodplains of Vermont at least as far back as the 1100s A.D.  (3) The Western Abenaki, including the Missisquoi, have a very definite and carefully maintained oral tradition that consistently references the Champlain valley in western Vermont.  (4) State recognition confers official acknowledgment of the long-standing existence in Vermont of Native American Indians who predated European settlement and enhances dignity and pride in their heritage and community.  (5) Many contemporary Abenaki families continue to produce traditional crafts and intend to continue to pass on these indigenous traditions to the younger generations. In order to create and sell Abenaki crafts that may be labeled as Indian- or Native American-produced, the Abenaki must be recognized by the State of Vermont.  (6) According to a public affairs specialist with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), State recognition of Indian tribes plays a very small role with regard to federal recognition. The only exception is when a state recognized a tribe before 1900.  (7) At least 15 other states have recognized their resident indigenous people as Native American Indian tribes without any of those tribes previously or subsequently acquiring federal recognition.  (8) State-recognized Native American Indian tribes and their members will continue to be subject to all laws of the State, and recognition shall not be construed to create any basis or authority for tribes to establish or promote any form of prohibited gambling activity or to claim any interest in land or real estate in Vermont.

Classified employees in exempt positions  (a) A State employee in the classified service, upon appointment to an exempt position, may request an indefinite leave of absence without pay from his or her classified position for so long as he or she remains in the exempt position. Upon approval in writing by the administrative head of the agency, department or like instrumentality in which the employee is serving, and upon concurrence by the Commissioner of Human Resources, the employee may enter the exempt position with rights determined under this section.  (b) During service in the exempt position, and if the approved request so specifies, the employee's rights to sick leave and rights under retirement and insurance plans shall be continued.

However, where the employee has at least 10 years of classified service, the Commissioner of Human Resources shall provide for the employee to be offered a position in the classified service, but not necessarily the former position, at the same or lower paygrade as the position previously held, provided the employee was not dismissed from the exempt position for cause. Any such offer of employment shall be made within 30 days of separation from the exempt position. For such employees entering the exempt service after July 1, 1994, their approved request for a leave of absence shall specify a request to return. Otherwise, the employee may be offered a classified position in State government if:  (1) the employee's approved request specifies a right to return to classified service;  (2) the classified position is vacant and is at the same or a lower pay grade as the employee's previous classified position; and  (3) the employee possesses the minimum qualifications required in the specification for that position class.  (d) If an employee accepts an offer of employment under subsection (c) of this section, and if the employee's approved request so specifies, the employee shall be entitled to the benefits of any increments to which he or she would have been entitled by reason of continuous service in a classified position, but for the appointment to the exempt position.  (e) Subject to the approval of the Governor, a classified employee who has satisfactorily completed any required probationary period, may be permitted to accept an assignment or appointment to fulfill the duties of an exempt position for a brief period of time, not to exceed one year, without having to resign or take a leave of absence from the classified service. Any such employee shall be compensated in accordance with compensation provisions applicable to the exempt position. (Added 1987, No. 243 (Adj. Sess.), 5, eff.

    "Chapter 14: Standards For Contracts Including Privatization Contracts": {
      "null": "341. Definitions  As used in this chapter:  (1) \"Agency\" means any agency, board, department, commission, committee, or authority of the Executive Branch of State government.  (2) \"Personal services contract\" means a contract for services that is categorized as personal services in accordance with procedures developed by the Secretary of Administration and is consistent with subdivisions 342(1), (2), and (3) of this title.  (3) \"Privatization contract\" means a contract for services valued at $25,000.00 or more per year, which is the same or substantially similar to and in lieu of services previously provided, in whole or in part, by permanent, classified State employees, and which results in a reduction in force of at least one permanent, classified employee, or the elimination of a vacant position of an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  (4) \"Contract for services\" means an agreement or combination or series of agreements by which an entity or individual agrees with an agency to provide services as a contractor, rather than as an employee. (Added 1999, No. 75 (Adj. Sess.), 2; amended 2009, No. 54, 107, eff. June 1, 2009; 2015, No. 78 (Adj. Sess.), 2.)  342. Contracting standards; contracts for services  Each contract for services valued at $25,000.00 or more per year shall require certification by the Office of the Attorney General to the Secretary of Administration that such contract for services is not contrary to the spirit and intent of the classification plan and merit system and standards of this title. A contract for services is contrary to the spirit and intent of the classification plan and merit system and standards of this title, and shall not be certified by the Office of the Attorney General as provided in this section, unless the provisions of subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this section are met, or one or more of the exceptions described in subdivision (4) of this section apply.  (1) The agency will not exercise supervision over the daily activities or methods and means by which the contractor provides services other than supervision necessary to ensure that the contractor meets performance expectations and standards; and  (2) The services provided are not the same as those provided by classified State employees within the agency; and  (3) The contractor customarily engages in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business; or  (4) Any of the following apply:  (A) The services are not available within the agency or are of such a highly specialized or technical nature that the necessary knowledge, skills, or expertise is not available within the agency.  (B) The services are incidental to a contract for purchase or lease of real or personal property.  (C) There is a demonstrated need for an independent audit, review, or investigation; or independent management of a facility is needed as a result of, or in response to, an emergency such as licensure loss or criminal activity.  (D) The State is not able to provide equipment, materials, facilities, or support services in the location where the services are to be performed in a cost-effective manner.  (E) The contract is for professional services, such as legal, engineering, or architectural services, that are typically rendered on a case-by-case or project-by-project basis, and the services are for a period limited to the duration of the project, normally not to exceed two years or provided on an intermittent basis for the duration of the contract.  (F) The need for services is urgent, temporary, or occasional, such that the time necessary to hire and train employees would render obtaining the services from State employees imprudent. Such contract shall be limited to 90 days' duration, with any extension subject to review and approval by the Secretary of Administration.  (G) Contracts for the type of services covered by the contract are specifically authorized by law.  (H) Efforts to recruit State employees to perform work, authorized by law, have failed in that no applicant meeting the minimum qualifications has applied for the job.  (I) The cost of obtaining the services by contract is lower than the cost of obtaining the same services by utilizing State employees. When comparing costs, the provisions of section 343 of this title shall apply. (Added 1999, No. 75 (Adj. Sess.), 2; amended 2015, No. 78 (Adj. Sess.), 3.)  343. Privatization contracts; procedure  (a) An agency shall not enter into a privatization contract, unless all of the following are satisfied:  (1) Thirty-five days prior to the beginning of any open bidding process, the agency provides written notice to the collective bargaining representative of the intent to seek to enter a privatization contract. During those 35 days, the collective bargaining representative shall have the opportunity to discuss alternatives to contracting. Such alternatives may include amendments to the contract if mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notices regarding the bid opportunity may not be issued during the 35-day discussion period. The continuation of discussions beyond the end of the 35-day period shall not delay the issuance of notices.  (2) The proposed contract is projected to result in overall cost savings to the State of at least 10 percent above the projected cost of having the services provided by classified State employees.  (3) When comparing the cost of having a service provided by classified State employees to the cost of having the service provided by a contractor:  (A) The expected costs of having services provided by classified State employees and obtaining the service through a contractor should be compared over the life of the contract. One-time costs associated with having services provided by a contractor rather than classified State employees, such as the expected cost of leave pay-outs for separating employees, unemployment compensation, and the cost of meeting the State's obligation, if any, to continue health insurance benefits, shall be spread over the expected life of the contract.  (B) The basic cost of services by a contractor includes:  (i) the bid price or maximum acceptable bid identified by the contracting authority; and  (ii) any additional costs to be incurred by the agency for inspection, facilities, reimbursable expenses, supervision, training, and materials, but only to the extent that these costs exceed the costs the agency could expect to incur for inspection, facilities, reimbursable expenses, and materials if the services were provided by classified State employees.  (C) The basic cost for services provided by a classified State employee includes:  (i) wages, benefits, and training;  (ii) the cost of supervision and facilities, but only to the extent that these costs exceed the costs the agency could expect to incur for supervision or facilities if the services were provided by a contractor; and  (iii) the estimated cost of obtaining goods when the comparison is with the cost of a contract that includes both goods and services.  (D) Possible reductions in the cost of obtaining services from classified State employees that require concessions shall not be considered unless proposed in writing by the certified collective bargaining agent and mutually agreed to by the State and collective bargaining agent.  (b)(1) A privatization contract shall contain specific performance measures regarding quantity, quality, and results and guarantees regarding the services performed.  (2) The agency shall provide information in the State's Workforce Report on the contractor's compliance with the specific performance measures set out in the contract.  (3) The agency may not renew the contract if the contractor fails to comply with the specific performance measures set out in the contract as required by subdivision (1) of this subsection.  (c)(1) Before an agency may renew a privatization contract for the first time, the Auditor of Accounts shall review the privatization contract analyzing whether it is achieving:  (A) the 10 percent cost-savings requirement set forth in subdivision (a)(2) of this section;  (B) the performance measures incorporated into the contract as required under subdivision (b)(1) of this section.  (2) If the Auditor of Accounts finds that a privatization contract has not achieved the cost savings required under subdivision (a)(2) of this section or complied with performance measures required under subdivision (b)(1) of this section, the Auditor of Accounts shall file a report with the agency and the House and Senate Committees on Government Operations, and the agency shall review whether to renew the privatization contract or perform the work with State employees. (Added 1999, No. 75 (Adj. Sess.), 2; amended 2017, No. 174 (Adj. Sess.), 1, eff. May 25, 2018.)  344. Contract administration  (a) The Secretary of Administration shall maintain a database with information about contracts for services, including approved privatization contracts and approved personal services contracts. The Secretary shall also maintain a database with information about privatization contracts that are rejected because they fail to qualify under subdivision 343(2) of this title. Contracts maintained in the database shall be public record to the extent provided under 1 V.S.A. chapter 5, and shall be located at the agency of origin, including information about names of contractors, summaries of work to be performed, costs, and duration.  (b) The information on contracts maintained in the database shall be reported to the General Assembly in the annual workforce report required under subdivision 309(a)(19) of this title. The provisions of 2 V.S.A. 20(d) (expiration of required reports) shall not apply to the report to be made under this subsection. (Added 1999, No. 75 (Adj. Sess.), 2; amended 2013, No. 142 (Adj. Sess.), 7; 2015, No. 78 (Adj. Sess.), 4.)  345. Equal pay in government contracts; certification  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an agency may not enter into a contract for goods with a contractor who does not provide written certification of compliance with the equal pay provisions of 21 V.S.A. 495(a)(7).  (b) A contractor subject to this section shall maintain and make available its books and records at reasonable times and upon notice to the contracting agency and the Attorney General so that either may determine whether the contractor is in compliance with this section. (Added 2013, No. 31, 3.)  346. State contracting; intellectual property, software design, and information technology  (a) The Secretary of Administration shall include in Administrative Bulletin 3.5 a policy direction applicable to State procurement contracts that include services for the development of software applications, computer coding, or other intellectual property, which would allow the State of Vermont to grant permission to the contractor to use or own the intellectual property created under the contract for the contractor's commercial purposes.  (b) The Secretary may recommend contract provisions that authorize the State to negotiate with a contractor to secure license terms and license fees, royalty rights, or other payment mechanism for the contractor's commercial use of intellectual property developed under a State contract.  (c) If the Secretary authorizes a contractor to own intellectual property developed under a State contract, the Secretary may recommend language to ensure the State retains a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, and fully paid right to continue to use the intellectual property including escrow for perpetual use at least annually. (Added 2013, No. 199 (Adj. Sess.), 18; amended 2019, No. 49, 2, eff. June 10, 2019.)  347. Contractor contribution restrictions  The Secretary of Administration shall include in the terms and conditions of sole source contracts a self-certification of compliance with the contractor contribution restrictions set forth in 17 V.S.A. 2950. (Added 2017, No. 79, 4a, eff. Dec. 16, 2018.)  348. Internet service providers; net neutrality compliance  (a) The Secretary of Administration shall develop a process by which an Internet service provider may certify that it is in compliance with the consumer protection and net neutrality standards established in subsection (b) of this section.  (b) A certificate of net neutrality compliance shall be granted to an Internet service provider that demonstrates and the Secretary finds that the Internet service provider, insofar as the provider is engaged in the provision of broadband Internet access service:  (1) Does not engage in any of the following practices in Vermont:  (A) Blocking lawful content, applications, services, or nonharmful devices, subject to reasonable network management.  (B) Impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of Internet content, application, or service or the use of a nonharmful device, subject to reasonable network management.  (C) Engaging in paid prioritization, unless this prohibition is waived pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.  (D) Unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging either a customer's ability to select, access, and use broadband Internet access service or lawful Internet content, applications, services, or devices of the customer's choice or an edge provider's ability to make lawful content, applications, services, or devices available to a customer. Reasonable network management shall not be considered a violation of this prohibition.  (E) Engaging in deceptive or misleading marketing practices that misrepresent the treatment of Internet traffic or content to its customers.  (2) Publicly discloses to consumers accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use of such services and for content, application, service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.  (c) The Secretary may waive the ban on paid prioritization under subdivision (b)(1)(C) of this section only if the Internet service provider demonstrates and the Secretary finds that the practice would provide some significant public interest benefit and would not harm the open nature of the Internet in Vermont.  (d) As used in this section:  (1) \"Broadband Internet access service\" means a mass-market retail service by wire or radio in Vermont that provides the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints, including any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the communications service, but excluding dial-up Internet access service. The term also encompasses any service in Vermont that the Secretary finds to be providing a functional equivalent of the service described in this subdivision, or that is used to evade the protections established in this chapter.  (2) \"Edge provider\" means any person in Vermont that provides any content, application, or service over the Internet and any person in Vermont that provides a device used for accessing any content, application, or service over the Internet.  (3) \"Internet service provider\" or \"provider\" means a business that provides broadband Internet access service to any person in Vermont.  (4) \"Paid prioritization\" means the management of an Internet service provider's network to favor directly or indirectly some traffic over other traffic, including through the use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, resource reservation, or other forms of preferential traffic management, either in exchange for consideration, monetary or otherwise, from a third party or to benefit an affiliated entity, or both.  (5) \"Reasonable network management\" means a practice that has a primarily technical network management justification but does not include other business practices and that is primarily used for and tailored to achieving a legitimate network management purpose, taking into account the particular network architecture and technology of the broadband Internet access service.  (e) The terms and definitions of this section shall be interpreted broadly and any exceptions interpreted narrowly, using relevant Federal Communications Commission orders, advisory opinions, rulings, and regulations as persuasive guidance. (Added 2017, No. 169 (Adj. Sess.), 2.)  349. State contracting; Internet service  The Secretary of Administration shall include in Administrative Bulletin 3.5 a requirement that State procurement contracts for broadband Internet access service, as defined in subdivision 348(d)(3) of this title, include terms and conditions requiring that the Internet service provider certify that it is in compliance with the consumer protection and net neutrality standards established in section 348 of this title.

Members  (a) Any person who was a member of either of the predecessor systems immediately preceding the date of establishment shall become a member of the Retirement System as of the date of establishment.  (b) Any person who became an employee within the three-year period prior to the date of establishment, but did not become a member of the Vermont Employees' Retirement System because he or she had not completed three consecutive years of service prior to the date of establishment, shall become a member as a condition of employment upon his or her completion of three consecutive years of service.  (c) Any person who becomes an employee after the date of establishment shall become a member as a condition of employment (1) upon the completion of three consecutive years of service in the case of those employees classified under subdivision 455(a)(9)(A) of this title hired prior to July 1, 1978; and (2) upon employment in the case of those employees classified under (B) of subdivision (a)(9), and upon employment in the case of those employees classified under subdivision 455(a)(9)(A) hired on or after July 1, 1978 except employees hired in a temporary capacity. No person shall join the system as a Group E member after December 31, 1990.  (d) Should any Group A, C, D, or F member who has less than five years of creditable service in any period of five consecutive years after last becoming a member be absent from service more than three years or should he or she withdraw his or her contributions, or become a beneficiary or die, he or she shall thereupon cease to be a member. However, the membership of any employee entering such classes of military or naval service of the United States as may be approved by resolution of the Retirement Board, shall be continued during such military or naval service if he or she does not withdraw his or her contributions, but no such member shall be considered in the service of the State for the purpose of the Retirement System during such military or naval service, except as provided in subsection 458(e) of this title.  (e) For purposes of benefits available under this chapter, former county court employees hired by the counties to court positions on or before June 30, 2008 who became State employees on February 1, 2011 pursuant to 2010 Acts and Resolves No. 154 shall be deemed to have been first included in membership of the system on or before June 30, 2008. (Added 1971, No. 231 (Adj. Sess.), 4; amended 1977, No. 153 (Adj. Sess.), 2; 1981, No. 41, 4; 1989, No. 277 (Adj. Sess.), 17g, eff. Jan. 1, 1991; 1997, No. 89 (Adj.

Creditable service; military service  (a) With respect to service rendered prior to the date of membership, each employee who, pursuant to subsection 457(a) of this title, became a member of the retirement system shall have included as prior service hereunder all service credited to him or her as creditable service under the terms of one or both of the predecessor systems, provided his or her membership continues unbroken until his or her retirement.  (b) All service of a group A, group C, group D, or group F member since he or she last became a member on account of which contributions are made shall be credited as membership service.  (c) The Retirement Board shall fix and determine by appropriate rules and regulations how much service in any year is equivalent to one year of service, but in no case shall it allow credit for a period of absence without pay of more than a month's duration, except as provided under subsection (e) of this section, nor shall more than one year of service be creditable for all service in one calendar year. Service rendered for the full normal working time in any year shall be equivalent to one year's service, but in no case shall less than 40 calendar weeks be regarded as full normal working time.  (d) Creditable service of a member shall consist of his or her membership service and the prior service, if any, which is credited to him or her under subsection (a) of this section, plus, in the case of a group A member hired prior to July 1, 1978, three years and in the case of a group F member, up to three years of the period served as a State employee prior to 1978 for which the member received no credit provided that the employee served continuously since 1978 until retirement. Creditable service shall also include service as an exempt employee for any period or periods of less than three years prior to 1978, whether or not continuous.  (e) Credit shall also be granted for any period of absence from service certified by the commissioner of the member's department, or if the office of the member is not overseen by a commissioner, then the head of the member's department, due to any class of military service approved by the Retirement Board, provided the employee returns to the service of the State within 90 days after having become discharged or separated from such military service, as if such service had been service as an employee of the State. The earnable compensation of the employee at the time of entering such military service shall be deemed to be the earnable compensation for the period of such service.  (f) Should an employee whose membership is broken again become a member, he or she shall enter the System as a member not entitled to credit for service previously rendered, except as provided in this section or section 463 of this title.  (g) Any member may transfer from a position covered by one group to a position covered by a different group as defined in section 455 of this title and shall be entitled to credit for service rendered in all groups within the System. Benefits shall be based on the accrued value of the credits in the group in which the creditable service was earned and shall be payable according to the provisions of each group, unless the member elects to withdraw his or her contributions in accordance with section 480 of this title. Such benefits shall only be subject to such maximum amounts as are provided for each group and may be combined to exceed 50 percent of average final compensation.  (h) Credit shall also be granted for any period of absence from service in connection with a leave of absence, approved by the commissioner of the member's department, for professional study. If the office of the member is not overseen by a commissioner, then the head of the member's department shall have the authority to approve a leave of absence for professional study. In the case of an approved leave of absence for purposes other than for professional study, service credit shall be granted upon a contribution by the member which equals the member's current contribution rate multiplied by the member's earnable compensation for the year preceding the leave of absence.  (i) Credit shall also be granted for any period of absence from service in connection with an approved workers' compensation claim as a result of a work-related injury, provided the employee provides evidence of the period covered by the approved workers' compensation claim upon return to active service. The earnable compensation of the employee at the time of entering the period of the absence from service resulting from an approved workers' compensation claim or the wages plus all other wage replacement compensation received while on the approved period of absence, whichever provides for the highest total compensation, shall be deemed to be the earnable compensation for the period of service. The total compensation under this subsection shall not exceed what the earnable compensation would have been had the member not been injured. (Added 1971, No. 231 (Adj.

Ordinary disability retirement  (a) Upon the application of a member or of his or her department head not later than 90 days, or longer for cause shown, after the date the member may have separated from service, any group A, group C, group D, or group F member who has had five or more years of creditable service may be retired by the retirement board on an ordinary disability retirement allowance, not less than 30 nor more than 90 days after filing such application; provided he or she is not eligible for accidental disability retirement; provided he or she has requested application prior to death; and provided that the Medical Board, after a medical examination of such member, shall certify that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, that such incapacity has existed since the time of the member's separation from service and is likely to be permanent, and that he or she should be retired. The Retirement Board may consider, or may ask the Medical Board or a certified vocational rehabilitation counselor to consider whether the individual is disabled from performing other types of suitable work. However, if disability is denied because the individual is found to be suitable for other work, the member shall be advised at the time of denial of the following provisions which shall apply:  (1) the individual will retain his or her existing retirement accrual status;  (2) the State shall provide any necessary retraining;  (3) there shall be no loss in pay;  (4) involuntary geographical moves beyond normal commuting distance are not permitted; and  (5) before any individual who is reassigned to another position rather than retired on disability may be terminated for performance reasons, the individual must first be reconsidered for disability retirement by the Retirement Board.

The Retirement Board may consult with a certified vocational rehabilitation counselor in determining whether the individual is incapacitated for the further performance of duty.  (b) Upon accidental disability retirement a member shall receive a normal retirement allowance if he or she shall have reached his or her normal retirement date; otherwise such a member shall receive a retirement allowance which shall be equal to:  (1) A normal retirement allowance payable at normal retirement date, based on the member's average final compensation at disability retirement and the number of years of creditable service the member would have completed had the member remained in service to his or her normal retirement date, multiplied by  (2) The ratio that the number of the member's years of creditable service at disability bears to the number of years of such service the member would have completed had the member remained in service to his or her normal retirement date; provided, however, that such allowance shall not be less than 25 percent of the member's average final compensation at the time of the member's disability retirement.  (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, a group C member, upon accidental disability retirement, shall receive as a minimum an allowance which will, when added to the member's Social Security benefit, be equal to 50 percent of the member's average final compensation plus 10 percent of the member's average final compensation for each dependent child, not in excess of three, who has not attained age 18 or, if a dependent student, has not attained age 23.  (d) Notwithstanding subsection (b) or (c) of this section, a member may not receive more than 50 percent of his or her average final compensation at the time of his or her disability retirement. (Added 1971, No. 231 (Adj. Sess.), 4; amended 2003, No. 38, 2; 2007, No. 13, 4.)  461a. Benefit denial; evidentiary hearing  (a) An applicant for disability retirement benefits under section 460 or 461 of this title may file a request for an evidentiary hearing with the Retirement Board if the application for benefits is denied.  (b) The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated by the Board and in conformance with rules adopted by the Board. Rules adopted by the Board shall be consistent with section 809 of this title.  (c) The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final administrative action. (Added 2003, No. 38, 5.)  462. Reexamination of disability beneficiary  (a) Once each year during the first five years following the retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance, and once in every three year period thereafter, the Retirement Board may, and upon the member's application shall, require any disability beneficiary who has not reached his or her normal retirement date to undergo a medical examination, by the Medical Board or by a physician or physicians designated by the Medical Board, such examination to be made at the place of residence of such beneficiary or other place mutually agreed upon. Should any disability beneficiary who has not reached his or her normal retirement date refuse to submit to such medical examination, the beneficiary's allowance may be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal, and should the beneficiary's refusal continue for one year, all the beneficiary's rights in and to his or her pension may be revoked by the Retirement Board.  (b) Should the Medical Board report and certify to the Retirement Board that any disability beneficiary has a residual functional capacity that might enable the beneficiary to return to work, and should the Retirement Board reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is engaged in or is, as a result of specific findings made by a certified vocational counselor, able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between the beneficiary's retirement allowance and his or her average final compensation at retirement, the beneficiary's pension shall be reduced to an amount that, together with his or her annuity and the amount earnable by him or her, shall equal the beneficiary's average final compensation at retirement, adjusted for inflation each year following retirement on the same basis as for beneficiaries as provided in section 470 of this title provided that:  (1) The Retirement Board shall provide written notice and an opportunity to be heard to the beneficiary prior to any reduction of the beneficiary's pension under this subsection (b).  (2) If the beneficiary has engaged in a gainful occupation subsequent to receiving disability retirement, the Retirement Board in its discretion may reject in whole or in part a vocational assessment of the beneficiary's ability to engage in a more gainful occupation and may rely in whole or in part on evidence of the beneficiary's actual earnings in determining the amount earnable by the beneficiary. In addition, if the Retirement Board's determination is based in whole or in part on a vocational assessment of ability to engage in a gainful occupation, the beneficiary shall be notified of his or her entitlement to the same reemployment rights as are available to State employees under the existing collective bargaining agreement entered into between the State and the applicable bargaining representative, or extension of such contractual benefits. Such rights shall commence as of the date of the determination and shall be based upon the reemployment rights the beneficiary would have had at the time he or she retired from State service. The reduction of pension amount will be held in abeyance until the reemployment rights have expired. In the event that the beneficiary is subsequently reemployed by the State, the beneficiary's retirement allowance shall cease, effective on the date when reemployment commences. In the event that the beneficiary is not subsequently reemployed by the State, the reduction of the beneficiary's pension shall commence the month following the month in which the beneficiary's reemployment rights expired.  (3) In the event that a beneficiary's pension has been reduced and should the beneficiary's earning capability later change, his or her pension may be further modified; provided that no reemployment rights shall be afforded to the beneficiary in connection with any later change and provided further that the new pension amount, together with the amount earnable by him or her, shall not exceed the beneficiary's average final compensation at retirement, adjusted for inflation.  (4) As used in this subsection, \"retirement allowance\" shall mean the allowance payable without modification as provided in section 468 of this title.  (c) Every recipient of disability benefits who has not reached his or her normal retirement date shall, annually on a date determined by the Retirement Board, file with the State Treasurer a statement certifying, under penalty of perjury and in such form as the Retirement Board shall prescribe, the full amount of his or her earnings from earned income during the preceding calendar year. The State Treasurer may request, and the beneficiary shall provide within 60 days after such request, additional financial information and records pertinent to the beneficiary's earned income. The beneficiary's statement and accompanying forms and schedules and any other financial information and records provided by the beneficiary to the State Treasurer shall be confidential. In the event that a beneficiary fails to submit the certification or any required or requested financial information or records pertinent to the beneficiary's earned income, the beneficiary's retirement allowance shall be suspended until all such information and records have been submitted, and in the event that the failure continues for one year, all the beneficiary's rights in and to his or her pension and any pending reemployment rights under this section may be revoked by the Board. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if the beneficiary's earned income for the preceding year exceeded the difference between the beneficiary's retirement allowance and his or her average final compensation at retirement as adjusted for inflation each year following retirement, the beneficiary shall refund the portion of the preceding year's retirement allowance that is equal to the amount of the reduction specified in subsection (b) of this section, and the refund amount may be offset against the beneficiary's monthly pension benefits. Prior to suspension or revocation of the beneficiary's retirement allowance, reemployment rights, or inception of any offset under this subsection, the Retirement Board shall provide the beneficiary with written notice and an opportunity to be heard. (Added 1971, No. 231 (Adj. Sess.), 4; amended 2003, No. 38, 3; 2015, No. 18, 11; 2015, No. 114 (Adj. Sess.), 1; 2017, No. 165 (Adj. Sess.), 3.)  463. Reinstatement  (a) Should a disability beneficiary be restored to service or should any other beneficiary be restored to service, his or her retirement allowance shall cease, and the beneficiary shall again become a member of the Retirement System. Anything in this subchapter to the contrary notwithstanding, upon his or her subsequent retirement, he or she shall be credited with all the service creditable to him or her at the time of his or her former retirement. However, if such beneficiary is restored to membership after the attainment of 55 years of age, his or her pension upon subsequent retirement shall not exceed the sum of the pension which he or she was receiving immediately prior to his or her last restoration to membership and the pension that may have accrued on account of membership service since his or her last restoration to membership, provided that the rate percent of his or her total pension on his or her subsequent retirement shall not exceed the rate he or she would have received had he or she remained in service during the period of prior retirement.  (b) A member who has been reemployed is entitled to prior service credit upon depositing in the fund the contributions which would have been deducted from the member's compensation had he or she remained a member with interest as set forth in subdivision 473(c)(1) of this title. The member in order to qualify for the prior service credit must also deposit in the fund a sum equal to the contributions which would have been contributed by the State had he or she remained a member with interest as set forth in subdivision 473(c)(1) of this title.

Accidental and occupationally related death benefit  (a) If the Retirement Board shall find on the basis of such evidence as may come before it that a group A, group D, or group F member in service died prior to his or her retirement under the system as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring at a definite time and place during the course of his or her performance of duty as an employee and that such accident was not the result of the member's own gross negligence or willful misconduct, a retirement allowance shall be paid to his or her designated dependent beneficiary during his or her life.  (b) If the Retirement Board shall find on the basis of such evidence as may come before it that a group C member in service died prior to his or her retirement under the system as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring at a definite time and place during the course of his or her performance of duty as an employee and that such accident was not the result of his or her own gross negligence or willful misconduct, a retirement allowance shall be paid to his or her dependent spouse during her or his life, or if there be no dependent spouse, or if the dependent spouse dies before the youngest child of the deceased member has attained age 18, age 23 in the case of a dependent student, then to his or her child or children under said age until the youngest of such children attains such age, divided in such manner as the Retirement Board in its discretion shall determine provided that the total annual payments to all such children shall not exceed the retirement allowance which would have been payable to the dependent spouse. If a member leaves no dependent spouse or child under said age upon his or her death, then a retirement allowance may be payable at the discretion of the Retirement Board to his or her dependent parent or parents provided that the total allowance payable shall not exceed the retirement allowance which would have been payable to the dependent spouse. In the case of the payment of a retirement allowance under this section to a child of a deceased group C member who is a dependent student, the retirement allowance shall continue while such child remains a dependent student until he or she attains age 23.  (c) The retirement allowance payable to the dependent spouse of a deceased member under this section shall be equal to 25 percent of the member's average final compensation at the time of his or her death.  (d) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, a dependent spouse of a deceased group C member under this section shall receive as a minimum an allowance which:  (1) If his or her compensation from the State was not subject to Social Security withholding will; or  (2) If his or her compensation from the State was subject to Social Security withholding will, when added to survivor's insurance benefit, be equal to 35 percent of average final compensation plus ten percent of average final compensation for each dependent child, not in excess of three, who has not attained age 18 or, if a dependent student, who has not attained age 23. Where, pursuant to this section, a retirement allowance is payable to a child or parent eligible for a survivor's insurance benefit the allowance payable under this subsection shall be inclusive of such person's survivor's insurance benefit.  (e) The retirement allowance payable to a dependent spouse under this section who also qualifies for an ordinary death benefit under section 465 of this title shall in no event be less than the death benefit which would otherwise be payable to such spouse under section 465 of this title. (Added 1971, No. 231 (Adj. Sess.), 4; amended 1981, No. 41, 12; 1985, No. 160 (Adj. Sess.), 1; 1989, No. 277 (Adj. Sess.), 17o, eff. Jan. 1, 1991; 1997, No. 89 (Adj. Sess.), 7; 2003, No. 122 (Adj. Sess.), 297a.)  465. Termination of service; ordinary death benefit  (a) Upon the withdrawal of a member from service prior to retirement for reasons other than death, the amount of his or her accumulated contributions will be returnable to him or her. In lieu of such return of contributions, any member who has completed five years of creditable service may allow his or her contributions to remain in the System and receive a deferred vested retirement allowance, commencing no earlier than the early retirement date, which shall be equal to:  (1) An early or normal retirement allowance based on his or her average final compensation at his or her date of termination of service and the number of years of creditable service he or she would have completed had he or she remained in service to his or her normal retirement date, multiplied by  (2) The ratio that the number of his or her years of creditable service at termination of service bears to the number of years of such service he or she would have completed had he or she remained in service to his or her normal retirement date, with early retirement reductions, if applicable.  (b)(1) Upon the death of a member in service who has not reached his or her normal retirement date and who has not completed 10 years of creditable service, as a result of causes other than those specified in section 464 of this title, the member's accumulated contributions shall be paid to such person as he or she shall have designated for such purpose in a writing duly acknowledged and filed with the Board. In the absence of a written designation of beneficiary or in the event the designated beneficiary is deceased, the return of accumulated contributions with interest payable as a result of the death of the member prior to retirement shall be payable as follows:  (A) In the case of an open estate, to the administrator or executor.  (B) In the case of a closed estate and the deceased member's account is valued at less than $1,000.00, in accordance with the Probate Division of the Superior Court decree of distribution.  (C) In the absence of an open estate or Probate Division of the Superior Court decree of distribution, and the deceased member's account is valued at less than $1,000.00 to the surviving spouse of the deceased owner, or, if there is no surviving spouse, to the next of kin according to 14 V.S.A. 551.  (D) In all other cases, a probate estate shall be opened by the claimant or other interested party in order to determine the appropriate distribution of the proceeds of the deceased member's account. When an estate is opened solely to distribute the proceeds of a deceased member's account under this section, the Probate Division of the Superior Court may waive any filing fees.  (2) In addition, if any member was in service at the date of the member's death or on approved leave of absence for professional study and had completed one or more years of creditable service, or if the member's death was the result of an accident while in service or on leave of absence, a pension equal to 10 percent of the member's average final compensation, but not less than $50.00 per month, will be payable on account of each of the member's dependent children under the age of 18, or, if a dependent student, under the age of 23, not exceeding a total of three. However, if a surviving child of any age was mentally or physically incapacitated to the extent that the child is impeded from substantial gainful employment before attaining age 18, the pension will be payable for the duration of the child's incapacity.  (c) If a Group A, Group D, or Group F member dies in service after becoming eligible for early retirement or after completing 10 years of creditable service, a retirement allowance will be payable to the member's designated dependent beneficiary during his or her life. If the designated dependent beneficiary so elects, however, the return of the member's accumulated contributions shall be made in lieu thereof.  (d) If a Group C member dies in service after reaching his or her normal retirement date or after completing 10 years of creditable service, a retirement allowance will be payable to the member's dependent spouse during her or his life, or if there be no dependent spouse, or if the dependent spouse dies before the youngest child of the deceased member has attained age 18, age 23 in the case of a dependent student, then to the member's child or children under said age until the youngest of such children attains such age, divided in such manner as the Retirement Board in its discretion shall determine provided that the total annual payments to all such children shall not exceed the retirement allowance which would have been payable to the dependent spouse. If a member leaves no dependent spouse or child under such age upon his or her death, then a retirement allowance may be payable at the discretion of the Retirement Board to his or her dependent parent or parents provided that the total allowance payable shall not exceed the retirement allowance which would have been payable to the dependent spouse. In the case of the payment of a retirement allowance under this section to a child of a deceased Group C member who is a dependent student, the retirement allowance shall continue while such child remains a dependent student until he or she attains age 23.  (e) Unless the designated dependent beneficiary elects to receive payment of a deceased member's accumulated contributions as provided under subsection (c) of this section, the retirement allowance payable to the designated dependent beneficiary of a deceased Group A, Group D, or Group F member under this section shall be equal to the retirement allowance that would have been payable had the member elected option 3 and retired on the member's date of death. In the case of a member who has not attained the normal retirement date as of his or her date of death, the retirement allowance shall be computed on the basis of a disability retirement allowance or an early retirement allowance, whichever provides the greater benefit to the dependent beneficiary. If the deceased member has no eligible dependent beneficiary, the member's accumulated contributions shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.  (f) The retirement allowance payable under this section to a dependent spouse of a Group C member who dies prior to normal retirement date shall be an allowance which will, when added to his or her survivor's insurance benefit, be equal to 70 percent of the retirement allowance which would have been payable to the deceased member had he or she retired on a normal or early retirement allowance, as the case may be, but without actuarial equivalent modification, on the date of the member's death plus ten percent of his or her average final compensation for each dependent child of the deceased member, not in excess of three, who has not attained age 18 or, if a dependent student, has not attained age 23. Where, pursuant to this section, a retirement allowance is payable to a child or parent eligible for a survivor's insurance benefit, the allowance payable under this subsection shall be inclusive of such person's survivor's insurance benefit.  (g) The provisions of subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f), and subdivision (b)(1) of this section shall not apply if benefits are payable under section 464 of this title. The provisions of subdivision (b)(2) of this section shall not apply if the benefits are paid under subsection 464(d) of this title.  (h) The provisions of subsections (e) and (g) of this section shall be retroactive to November 5, 1969 only for the account of George R. Dearborn, deceased.  (i) Any reduced retirement allowance payable during the life of the retired member, with a provision that it shall continue after his or her death for the life of the member's beneficiary, shall be determined as actuarial equivalents of the retirement allowance under subdivision (a)(1) of this section. Any member who elects to receive such a retirement allowance may elect to receive a benefit further reduced actuarially as prescribed by the Board with the added provision that, should the retired member survive his or her nominated beneficiary, the retirement allowance which would have been payable under subdivision (a)(1) shall be paid to the retired member during the remainder of his or her lifetime. If a member does not make an election as to the form of his or her retirement allowance, he or she shall receive his or her retirement allowance under the provisions of subdivision (a)(1).  (j) The survivors of a member who dies after December 31, 2006 while performing qualified military service shall be entitled to any additional benefits, other than benefit accruals related to the period of qualified military service, that would have been provided under the Plan had the member resumed employment and then terminated employment on account of death.

Coordination of disability retirement benefits with workers' compensation benefits  (a) Disability pension and annuity retirement benefits payable under this chapter shall not commence until workers' compensation benefits have been exhausted under 21 V.S.A. 642 or 646.  (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, disability retirement benefits payable under this chapter shall be paid to a member who applies for and meets all of the eligibility criteria for disability retirement under section 460 or 461 of this title, has filed a claim for temporary disability workers' compensation benefits under 21 V.S.A. 642 or 646, and for whom no such benefits have been or are being paid pursuant to any of these sections. If the disability retiree receives temporary workers' compensation benefits pursuant to 21 V.S.A. 642 or 646, disability retirement pension and annuity benefit payments shall cease immediately and the retiree shall be immediately restored to his or her employment position and status as existed immediately preceding separation from service as an employee, including restoration of all benefits that existed at that time. Acceptance of disability retirement benefits prior to being restored to State service shall not act as a waiver under subsection (d) of this section.  (c) No employee shall concurrently receive both disability retirement benefits payable under this chapter and workers' compensation benefits payable under section 21 V.S.A. 642 or 646. If an employee receives disability retirement pension and annuity benefits and later receives an award for temporary disability workers' compensation benefits for the same period, the Vermont State Retirement System shall have a lien against any retroactive workers' compensation award under 21 V.S.A. 642 or 646 for the same period that the employee received disability retirement benefits in the amount of the disability retirement pension and annuity benefits paid. Any recovery under 21 V.S.A. 642 or 646 against the employer or the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier shall, after deducting expenses of recovery, reimburse the Vermont State Retirement System for disability retirement pension and annuity benefits for all retroactive periods of time included in the recovery. The State Treasurer shall notify the Department of Buildings and General Services when a disability retirement application is approved for an employee who has filed a workers' compensation claim. The Department of Buildings and General Services or its workers' compensation insurance carrier shall notify the State Treasurer of commencement or termination of any workers' compensation payments or awards to an employee who has been reported by the State Treasurer as eligible to receive disability retirement benefits.  (d) An employee who chooses to accept disability retirement benefits payable under this chapter, except as otherwise described under this section and subsection (b) of this section, shall waive any claim for benefits in excess of 330 weeks under 21 V.S.A. 644 and 645. Under this subsection, an employee may receive permanent disability benefits under 21 V.S.A. chapter 9 and disability retirement benefits under this chapter simultaneously for up to 330 weeks. Prior to actual payment of disability retirement benefits, the disability retiree shall make an election of what benefit he or she wants to receive after 330 weeks by indicating on a form provided by the State Treasurer at the time of application. The form shall advise the disability retiree in conspicuous print that he or she may wish to consult with legal counsel prior to making the election. (Added 1971, No. 231 (Adj.

Death benefit after retirement- Group C  If a group C member in receipt of a retirement allowance dies, his or her dependent spouse shall receive until her or his death a retirement allowance which shall be equal to 70 percent of the retirement allowance to which the member was then entitled, without optional modification, irrespective of whether such member had elected an option hereunder.

(1) Option 1. A reduced retirement allowance payable during the member's life, with the provision that at the member's death a lump sum equal in amount to the difference between the member's accumulated contributions at the time of retirement and the sum of the annuity payments actually made to the member during his or her lifetime shall be paid to such person, if any, as the member has nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the Retirement Board; or, in the absence of a written designation of beneficiary or when the designated beneficiary is deceased, the residual amount payable as a result of the death of the member after retirement shall be payable as follows  (2) [Deleted.]  (A) In the case of an open estate, to the administrator or executor.  (B) In the case of a closed estate and the deceased member's account is valued at less than $1,000.00, in accordance with the Probate Division of the Superior Court decree of distribution.  (C) In the absence of an open estate or Probate Division of the Superior Court decree of distribution, and the deceased member's account is valued at less than $1,000.00 to the surviving spouse of the deceased owner, or, if there is no surviving spouse, then to the next of kin according to 14 V.S.A. 551.  (D) In all other cases, a probate estate shall be opened by the claimant, or other interested party, in order to determine the appropriate distribution of the proceeds of the deceased member's account. When an estate is opened solely to distribute the proceeds of a deceased member's account under this section, the Probate Division of the Superior Court may waive any filing fees; or  (3) Option 3. A reduced retirement allowance payable during the member's life, with the provision that it shall continue after the member's death for the life of the beneficiary nominated by the member by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the Retirement Board at the time of retirement should such beneficiary survive the member; or  (4) Option 4.

(b) Any member who elects to receive a retirement allowance under the provisions of option 3 or 4 may elect to receive a benefit further reduced actuarially as prescribed by the Board with the added provision that on the basis of stipulations contained in a plan-approved domestic relations order or if the retired member survives the member's nominated beneficiary, the retirement allowance which would have been payable during the member's life computed pursuant to section 459, 460, or 461 of this title, whichever is applicable, shall be paid to the retired member during the remainder of the member's lifetime.

Postretirement adjustments to retirement allowances  (a) For Group A, Group C, and Group D members, as of June 30th in each year, commencing June 30, 1972, a determination shall be made of any increase or decrease, to the nearest one-tenth of a percent, in the ratio of the average of the Consumer Price Index for the month ending on that date to the average of said index for the month ending on June 30, 1971, or the month ending on June 30th of the most recent year subsequent thereto. In the event of an increase, and provided that the net increase following the application of any offset as provided in this subsection equals or exceeds one percent, the retirement allowance of each beneficiary in receipt of an allowance for at least one year on the next following December 31st shall be increased by an equal percentage. Such increase shall commence on the January 1st immediately following such December 31st. Such percentage increase shall also be made in the retirement allowance payable to a beneficiary in receipt of an allowance under an optional election, provided the member on whose account the allowance is payable and such other person shall have received a total of at least 12 monthly payments by such December 31st. In the event of a decrease of the Consumer Price Index as of June 30th for the preceding year, the retirement allowance of a beneficiary shall not be subject to any adjustment on the next following January 1st; provided, however, that:  (1) such decrease shall be applied as an offset against the first subsequent year's increase of the Consumer Price Index when such increase equals or exceeds one percent, up to the full amount of such increase; and  (2) to the extent that such decrease is greater than such subsequent year's increase, such decrease shall be offset in the same manner against two or more years of such increases, for up to but not exceeding five subsequent years of such increases, until fully offset.  (b) For Group F members, as of June 30th in each year, commencing January 1, 1991, a determination shall be made of any increase or decrease, to the nearest one-tenth of a percent of the Consumer Price Index for the preceding fiscal year. In the event of an increase, and provided that there exists a net increase following the application of any offset as provided in this subsection, the retirement allowance of each beneficiary in receipt of an allowance for at least one year on the next following December 31st shall be increased by an amount equal to one-half of the net percentage increase. Commencing January 1, 2014, the retirement allowance of each beneficiary who was an active contributing member of the Group F plan on or after June 30, 2008, and who retires on or after July 1, 2008, shall be increased by an amount equal to the net percentage increase. The increase shall commence on the January 1st immediately following such December 31st. The increase shall apply to Group F members receiving an early retirement allowance only in the year following attainment of normal retirement age, provided the member has received benefits for at least 12 months as of December 31st of the year preceding any January adjustment. In the event of a decrease of the Consumer Price Index as of June 30th for the preceding year, the retirement allowance of a beneficiary shall not be subject to any adjustment on the next following January 1st; provided, however, that:  (1) such decrease shall be applied as an offset against the first subsequent year's increase of the Consumer Price Index, up to the full amount of such increase; and  (2) to the extent that such decrease is greater than such subsequent year's increase, such decrease shall be offset in the same manner against two or more years of such increases, for up to but not exceeding five subsequent years of such increases, until fully offset.  (c) For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the maximum amount of any increase or decrease utilized to determine the net percentage increase shall be five percent. For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, the maximum amount of any increase or decrease utilized to determine the net percentage increase shall be five percent, and any increase or decrease of less than one percent shall be assigned a value of one percent.

Retirement Board; Medical Board; actuary; rates of contribution; safekeeping of securities  (a) The general administration and responsibility for the proper operation of the Retirement System and for making effective the provisions of this subchapter are hereby vested in a board of eight trustees, known as the Retirement Board. The Board shall consist of the Governor or his or her designated representative, the State Treasurer, the Commissioner of Human Resources, the Commissioner of Finance and Management, three members of the Vermont State Employees' Association who are members of the System, each to be chosen by such Association in accordance with its articles of association and bylaws or policies for a term of two years, and one retired State employee who is a beneficiary of the System, to be elected by the Vermont Retired State Employees' Association for a term of two years. If a vacancy occurs in the office of a chosen member, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in accordance with the articles of association and bylaws or policies of the association affected by the vacancy. In the absence of a member of the State Employees' Association or the Retired State Employees' Association, the respective association may designate a person who is a member of the Association to attend a meeting or meetings of the Retirement Board in place of the absent member. A person so designated shall have the same voting rights and responsibilities as the absent member he or she is representing at such meeting or meetings, except that the person shall not automatically assume the trustee's place as an officer of the Board.  (b) The trustees as such shall serve without compensation, but they shall be reimbursed from the funds of the Retirement System for all necessary expenses that they may incur through service on the Retirement Board.  (c) Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote in the Retirement Board. Five trustees shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. A majority vote of those present and voting shall be necessary for any resolution or action by the Retirement Board at any meeting of the Board. All trustees shall be notified of any meeting of the Board. The State Treasurer, the Commissioner of Finance and Management, and the Commissioner of Human Resources each may designate in writing a person within the trustee's office or department to attend a meeting or meetings of the Retirement Board in the Treasurer's or the Commissioner's place. The designation shall be filed with the Secretary of the Board. A person so designated shall have the same voting rights and responsibilities as the ex officio trustee at such meeting or meetings except that the designee shall not automatically assume the trustee's place as an officer of the Board.  (d) Subject to the limitations of this subchapter, the Retirement Board shall, from time to time, establish rules and regulations for the administration of the Fund of the Retirement System and for the transaction of its business.  (e) The Retirement Board shall elect from its membership a chair and shall appoint a secretary who may be, but need not be, one of the trustees. It shall engage such medical, actuarial, and other services as shall be required to transact the business of the Retirement System. The compensation of all persons engaged by the Retirement Board, and all other expenses of the Board necessary for the operation of the Retirement System, shall be paid at such rates and in such amounts as the Board shall approve.  (f) The Retirement Board shall keep in convenient form such data as shall be necessary for actuarial valuation of the fund of the Retirement System, and for checking the experience of the System.  (g) The Retirement Board shall keep a record of all its proceedings, which shall be open to public inspection. It shall publish annually and distribute to the General Assembly a report showing the fiscal transactions of the Retirement System for the preceding fiscal year, the amount of the accumulated cash and securities of the System, and the last balance sheet showing the financial condition of the Retirement System by means of an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the System. The provisions of 2 V.S.A. 20(d) (expiration of required reports) shall not apply to the report to be made under this subsection.  (h) The Attorney General of the State shall be legal advisor to the Retirement Board.  (i) The Retirement Board shall designate a Medical Board to be composed of three physicians not eligible to participate in the Retirement System. If required, other physicians may be employed to report on special cases. The Medical Board shall arrange for and pass upon all medical examinations required under the provisions of this subchapter, shall investigate all essential medical statements and certificates by or on behalf of a member in connection with a claim of disability or accidental and occupationally-related death, and shall report in writing to the Retirement Board of its conclusions and recommendations upon all such matters.  (j) The Retirement Board shall designate an actuary who shall be the technical advisor of the Board on matters regarding the operation of the Fund of the Retirement System, and shall perform such other duties as are required in connection therewith. Immediately after the establishment of the Retirement System, the Retirement Board shall adopt for the Retirement System such mortality and service tables as shall be deemed necessary and shall certify the rates of contribution payable under the provisions of this subchapter. At least once in each three-year period following the establishment of the System, the actuary shall make an actuarial investigation into the mortality, service, and compensation experience of the members and beneficiaries of the Retirement System, and taking into account the results of such investigation, the Retirement Board shall adopt for the Retirement System such mortality, service, and other tables as shall be deemed necessary and shall certify the rates of contribution payable under the provisions of this subchapter.  (k) On the basis of such mortality and service tables as the Retirement Board shall adopt, the actuary shall make annual valuations of the assets and liabilities of the fund of the Retirement System.  (l) The Commission shall designate from time to time a depositary for the securities and evidences of indebtedness held in the Fund of the System and may contract for the safekeeping of securities and evidences of indebtedness within and without the State of Vermont in such banks, trust companies, and safe-deposit facilities as it shall from time to time determine. The necessary and incidental expenses of such safekeeping and for service rendered, including advisory services in investment matters, shall be paid from the operation expenses of the System as hereinafter provided. Any agreement for the safekeeping of securities or evidences of indebtedness shall provide for the access to such securities and evidences of indebtedness, except securities loaned pursuant to a securities lending agreement as authorized by subsection (m) of this section, at any time by the custodian or any authorized agent of the State for audit or other purposes.  (m) The Commission may authorize the loan of its securities pursuant to securities lending agreements that provide for collateral consisting of cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies equal to 100 percent or more of the market value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral may be invested by the lending institution in investments approved by the State Treasurer. Approval of investments shall be made in accordance with the standard of care established by the prudent investor rule under 9 V.S.A. chapter 147.  (n) The Board shall review annually the amount of State contribution recommended by the actuary of the Retirement System as necessary to achieve and preserve the financial integrity of the fund established pursuant to section 473 of this title. Based on this review, the Board shall recommend the amount of State contribution that should be appropriated for the next fiscal year to achieve and preserve the financial integrity of the fund. On or before November 1 of each year, the Board shall submit this recommendation to the Governor and the House and Senate Committees on Government Operations and on Appropriations. The provisions of 2 V.S.A. 20(d) (expiration of required reports) shall not apply to the report to be made under this subsection. (Added 1971, No. 231 (Adj. Sess.), 4; amended 1987, No. 92, 2, eff.

Investments; interest rate; disbursements  (a) The members of the Vermont Pension Investment Commission established in chapter 17 of this title shall be the trustees of the Funds created by this subchapter, 16 V.S.A. chapter 55, and 24 V.S.A. chapter 125, and with respect to them may invest and reinvest the assets of the Fund, and hold, purchase, sell, assign, transfer, and dispose of the securities and investments in which the assets of the Fund have been invested and reinvested. Investments shall be made in accordance with the standard of care established by the prudent investor rule under 9 V.S.A. chapter 147.

(c) The State Treasurer shall be the custodian of the assets of the Fund of the Retirement System. All payments from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer or his or her deputy, with approval of the Retirement Board. A duly attested copy of a resolution of the Retirement Board designating such persons and bearing on its face specimen signatures of such persons shall be filed with the State Treasurer as his or her authority for making payments upon such vouchers.  (d) Except as otherwise herein provided, no trustee and no employee of the Board or member of the Commission shall have any direct interest in the gains or profits of any investment made by the Commission; nor shall any trustee or employee of the Board or the Commission, directly or indirectly, for himself or herself or as an agent, in any manner use the same except to make such current and necessary payments as are authorized by the Board or Commission; nor shall any trustee or employee of the Board or the Commission become an endorser or surety, or in any manner an obligor, for the monies loaned to or borrowed from the Board. The Treasurer, with the approval of the Board and the Commission, shall adopt by rule standards of conduct for trustees and employees of the Board in order to maintain and promote public confidence in the integrity of the Board. Such rules shall prohibit trustees and employees from receiving or soliciting any gift, including meals, alcoholic beverages, travel fare, room and board, or any other thing of value, tangible or intangible, from any vendor or potential vendor of investment services, management services, brokerage services, and other services to the Board or Commission.

Sess.), 4; 2005, No. 50, 5; 2007, No. 13, 9; 2021, No. 75, 5, eff. June 8, 2021.)  472a. Compliance with federal law  (a) Intent. The General Assembly intends that the Retirement System and any trusts or custodial accounts established to hold the assets of the Retirement System in accordance with subsection (b) of this section be maintained, in form and operation, so as to maintain the status of the Retirement System as a qualified plan under 26 U.S.C. 401(a) as amended, and the tax exempt status of such trusts and custodial accounts under 26 U.S.C. 501(a), to the extent that those requirements apply to a governmental plan as described in 26 U.S.C. 414. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, this section shall be applicable, administered, and interpreted in a manner consistent with maintaining the tax qualification of the Retirement System as a qualified plan and the tax exempt status of such trusts and custodial accounts under 26 U.S.C. 401(a) and 501(a), respectively.  (b) Exclusive benefit. All assets of the Retirement System shall be held in trust, in one or more custodial accounts treated as trusts in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 401(f), or in a combination thereof. Under any trust or custodial account, it shall be impossible at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to members and their beneficiaries for any part of the corpus or income to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than the exclusive benefit of members and their beneficiaries. However, this requirement shall not prohibit:  (1) the return of a contribution within six months after the Retirement System determines that the contribution was made by a mistake of fact; or  (2) payment of the expenses of the Retirement System.  (c) Vesting on plan termination. In the event of the termination of the Retirement System, the accrued benefits of eligible members shall become fully and immediately vested.  (d) Forfeitures. Service credits forfeited by a member for any reason shall not be applied to increase the benefits of any other member.  (e) Required distributions. Distributions shall begin to be made not later than the member's required beginning date as defined under 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9) and shall be made in accordance with all other requirements of that subsection. Benefits shall be paid under the maximum allowance pursuant to this subsection even though the member has not previously applied to receive them. The System shall be deemed to be in compliance with the terms of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9) so long as it is administered under a reasonable good faith interpretation of that subsection.  (f) Limitation on benefits. Benefits shall not be payable to the extent that they exceed the limitations imposed by 26 U.S.C. 415, as adjusted for increases in the cost of living.  (g) Limitation on compensation. Benefits and contributions shall not be computed with reference to any compensation that exceeds the maximum dollar amount permitted by 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(17) as adjusted for increases in the cost of living.  (h) Actuarial determination. Whenever the amount of any member's benefit is to be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions done by a professional actuary, those assumptions shall be specified by resolution, which documentation shall be incorporated in the System by reference. The Board shall also adopt interest and mortality assumptions for the purposes of determining actuarial equivalent benefits under the system. The Board shall adopt assumptions by resolution, which documentation shall be incorporated in the System by reference.  (i) Direct rollovers. An individual withdrawing a distribution from the Retirement System which constitutes an \"eligible rollover distribution\" within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. 402, may elect, in the time and manner prescribed by the Retirement Board and after receipt of proper notice, to have any portion of the distribution paid directly to another plan that is qualified under 26 U.S.C. 401(a), to an annuity plan described in 26 U.S.C. 403(a), to an annuity contract described in 26 U.S.C. 403(b), or to an eligible plan described in 26 U.S.C. 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to account separately for amounts transferred into the plan, or to an individual retirement account or annuity described in 26 U.S.C. 408(a) or (b), in a direct rollover. For distributions made after December 31, 2009, a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary under 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9) may establish an individual retirement account into which all or a portion of a death distribution from the Retirement System to which such nonspouse beneficiary is entitled can be transferred directly.  (j) Compliance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, contributions, benefits, and service credits with respect to qualified military service shall be provided under the System in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 414(u), unless State law provides more favorable benefits than those required by federal law.  (k) Consent. An individual who is not a vested member of the System and who has not yet reached the later of normal retirement age or age 62 must consent to any withdrawal of his or her assets of greater than $1,000.00. For individuals who are not vested members of the System and who have reached the later of normal retirement age or age 62, amounts greater than $1,000.00 may be paid out without the individual's consent. In all cases, amounts of $1,000.00 or less may be paid out without the individual's consent.  (l) Rules. The Board may adopt rules to ensure that this chapter complies with federal law requirements. (Added 2007, No. 13, 10; amended 2009, No. 24, 4; 2015, No. 18, 2; 2017, No. 165 (Adj. Sess.), 4; 2019, No. 14, 3, eff. April 30, 2019.)  473. Funds  (a) Assets. All of the assets of the Retirement System shall be credited to the Vermont State Retirement Fund.  (b) Member contributions.  (1) Contributions deducted from the compensation of members together with any member contributions transferred thereto from the predecessor systems shall be accumulated in the Fund and separately recorded for each member. The amounts so transferred on account of Group A members shall be allocated between regular and additional contributions. The amounts so allocated as regular contributions shall be determined as if the rate of contribution of four percent has been continuously in effect in the predecessor system from which such amounts were transferred and the balance of any amount so transferred on account of any Group A member shall be deemed additional contributions. In the case of Group C members who were members as of the date of establishment and Group D members, all contributions transferred from predecessor systems shall be deemed regular contributions. Those members who, prior to the date of establishment of this system, had been contributing at a rate less than four percent shall have any benefit otherwise payable on their behalf actuarially reduced to reflect such prior contribution rate of less than four percent. Upon a member's retirement or other withdrawal from service on the basis of which a retirement allowance is payable, the member's additional contributions, with interest thereon, shall be paid as an additional allowance equal to an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of such amount, in the same manner as the benefit otherwise payable under the System.  (2) Commencing on July 1, 2016, contributions shall be 6.55 percent of compensation for Group A, D, and F members and 8.43 percent of compensation for Group C members. When the State Employees' Retirement System has been determined by the actuary to have assets at least equal to its accrued liability, contribution rates will be reevaluated by the actuary with a subsequent recommendation to the General Assembly. In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the Retirement Board may consider the annual or other periodic rate of earnable compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period, and it may omit deduction from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if an employee was not a member on the first day of the payroll period, and to facilitate the making of deductions it may modify the deduction required of any member by such an amount as, on an annual basis, shall not exceed one-tenth of one percent of the annual earnable compensation upon the basis of which such deduction is to be made. Each of the amounts shall be deducted until the member retires or otherwise withdraws from service, and when deducted shall be paid into the Annuity Savings Fund, and shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose compensation the deduction was made.  (3) The deductions provided for herein shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided for by law for any member shall be reduced thereby. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided herein and shall receipt for full compensation, and payment of compensation less such deduction shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment, except as to the benefits provided under this subchapter.  (4) Subject to the approval of the Retirement Board, in addition to the contributions deducted from compensation as hereinbefore provided, any member may redeposit in the Fund by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution an amount equal to the total amount which the member previously withdrew from this System or one of the predecessor systems; or any member may deposit therein by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution an amount computed to be sufficient to purchase an additional annuity which, together with prospective retirement allowance, will provide for the member a total retirement allowance not in excess of one-half of average final compensation at normal retirement date, with the exception of Group D members for whom creditable service shall be restored upon redeposits of amounts previously withdrawn from the System, or for whom creditable service shall be granted upon deposit of amounts equal to what would have been paid if payment had been made during any period of service during which such a member did not contribute. Such additional amounts so deposited shall become a part of the member's accumulated contributions as additional contributions.  (5) The contributions of a member and such interest as may be allowed thereon which are withdrawn by the member or paid to the member estate or to a designated beneficiary in event of the member's death, shall be paid from the Fund.  (6) Contributions required under this subsection shall be limited to contributions from Group A, Group C, Group D, and Group F members.  (7) [Repealed.]  (c) Employer contributions, earnings, and payments.  (1) Employer contributions and the reserves for the payment of all pensions and other benefits, including all interest and dividends earned on the assets of the Retirement System shall be accumulated in the Fund, and all benefits payable under the System and the expenses of the System shall be paid from the Fund. Annually, the Retirement Board shall allow regular interest on the individual accounts of members in the Fund which shall be credited to each member's account within the Fund.  (2) Beginning with the actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2006, the contributions to be made to the Fund by the State shall be determined on the basis of the actuarial cost method known as \"entry age normal.\" On account of each member there shall be paid annually into the Fund by the State an amount equal to certain percentages of the annual earnable compensation of such member, to be known as the \"normal contribution,\" and additional amounts equal to a certain percentage of the member's annual earnable compensation, to be known as the \"basic accrued liability\" and \"additional accrued liability\" contributions. The percentage rates of the contributions shall be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the Retirement System as shown by actuarial valuation.  (3) The normal contribution shall be the uniform percentage of the total compensation of members which, if contributed over each member's prospective period of service and added to such member's prospective contributions, if any, will be sufficient to provide for the payment of all future benefits after subtracting the sum of the unfunded accrued liability and the total assets of the Fund of the Retirement System.  (4) Beginning on July 1, 2008, until the unfunded accrued liability is liquidated, the basic accrued liability contribution shall be the annual payment required to liquidate the unfunded accrued liability over a closed period of 30 years ending on June 30, 2038, provided that:  (A) From July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2019, the amount of each annual basic accrued liability contribution shall be determined by amortization of the unfunded liability over the remainder of the closed 30-year period in installments increasing at a rate of five percent per year.  (B) Beginning on July 1, 2019 and annually thereafter, the amount of each annual basic accrued liability contribution shall be determined by amortization of the unfunded liability over the remainder of the closed 30-year period in installments increasing at a rate of three percent per year.  (C) Any variation in the contribution of normal, basic, unfunded accrued liability or additional unfunded accrued liability contributions from those recommended by the actuary and any actuarial gains and losses shall be added or subtracted to the unfunded accrued liability and amortized over the remainder of the closed 30-year period.  (5)-(7) [Repealed.]  (d) Contributions of State. As provided by law, the Retirement Board shall certify to the Governor or Governor-Elect a statement of the percentage of the payroll of all members sufficient to pay for all operating expenses of the Vermont State Retirement System and all contributions of the State that will become due and payable during the next biennium. The contributions of the State shall be charged to the departmental appropriation from which members' salaries are paid and shall be included in each departmental budgetary request.  (e) [Repealed.]  (f) Contributions paid by State. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (b)(2) of this section to the contrary and pursuant to the provisions of Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, the State shall pick up and pay the contributions required to be paid by members with respect to service rendered on and after March 1, 1998. Contributions picked up by the State shall be designated for all purposes as member contributions, except that they shall be treated as State contributions in determining tax treatment of a distribution. Each member's compensation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount picked up by the State. This reduction, however, shall not be used to determine annual earnable compensation for purposes of determining average final compensation. Contributions picked up under this subsection shall be credited to the Fund. To ensure that the provisions of this subsection are cost neutral to the State, the contributions rates established under subdivision 473(b)(2) of this title shall be increased by one-tenth of one percent of compensation.

Sess.), E.133.1; 2017, No. 74, 2.)  473a. Periodic actuarial reports  The Board shall cause to be made an actuarial reevaluation of the rate of member contributions deducted from earnable compensation pursuant to subdivision 473(b)(2) of this title, on a periodic basis at least every three years, to determine whether the amount deducted is necessary to make the contributions picked up and paid by the State for such members cost neutral to the General Fund. The actuarial reevaluation shall consider all relevant factors, including federal tax law changes. The Board shall report the results of the actuarial reevaluation to the General Assembly together with any recommendations for adjustment in the members' contribution rate under subdivision 473(b)(2) of this title. The provisions of 2 V.S.A. 20(d) (expiration of required reports) shall not apply to the report to be made under this section. (Added 1997, No. 68 (Adj. Sess.), 8, eff.

Predecessor systems  Any beneficiary of a predecessor system who is in receipt of a benefit on the date of establishment shall become a beneficiary hereunder and shall continue to receive the benefit being paid from the Fund of this System, under the conditions of the predecessor system as in effect at the time of the member's retirement, subject to such adjustment as provided for in section 470 of this title. Any former member of a predecessor system who, upon termination of service, was eligible for a deferred benefit under the provisions of that System, the payment of which has not commenced as of the date of establishment, shall continue to be so eligible, and shall receive such benefit from the System subject to the conditions of the predecessor system as in effect at the time the member's service was terminated. The cash and securities to the credit of the predecessor systems on the date of establishment shall be transferred to this Retirement System, the amount of each member's accumulated contributions included in such transfer shall be credited to the member's individual account in the fund to become a part of the member's accumulated contributions, and the balance shall be credited to the Fund.

Errors  Should any change or error in the records result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the Retirement System more or less than he or she would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the Retirement Board shall have the power to correct such error, and to adjust as far as practicable the payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid or in such a manner that the impact upon the Fund is de minimis.

It also means a judgment, decree, or order from a court of competent jurisdiction in another state, concerning marital property rights that includes a transfer of all, or a portion of, a member's or beneficiary's payment rights in the Retirement System to an alternate payee. Domestic relations orders shall conform to the requirements of this section in order to be effective. A domestic relations order does not take effect until it is served on the Retirement System by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. In the event that there is more than one domestic relations order, the order which is most recent in time and which has been served on the Retirement System will control.  (b) A member's or beneficiary's rights in the Retirement System may be modified by a domestic relations order as provided in this section.  (c) A domestic relations order shall contain all of the following elements:  (1) the identity of the member or beneficiary and the alternate payee by full name, current address, and Social Security number;  (2) the amount or percentage of the member's or beneficiary's benefits to be paid by the Board to the alternate payee and the date or dates upon which the calculation of payments is to be based;  (3) the number of payments or time period in which payments are required to be made under the domestic relations order;  (4) each retirement plan to which the domestic relations order applies.

(i) The Board, the Retirement System, its agents and employees shall not be liable to any person for carrying out the terms and conditions of a domestic relations order.  (j) The Board may adopt rules to implement this section. (Added 1995, No. 36, 2; amended 2009, No. 154 (Adj. Sess.), 238.)  477. Prior service credit  An employee who has ceased being a member upon reemployment is entitled to prior service credit upon depositing in the Fund the contributions which would have been deducted from the employee's compensation had he or she remained a member with interest as set forth in section 473 of this title. The employee in order to qualify for the prior service credit must also deposit in the Fund a sum equal to the contributions which would have been contributed by the State had the employee remained a member with interest as set forth in section 473 of this title. (Added 1971, No. 231 (Adj. Sess.), 4; amended 2007, No. 13, 14.)  477a. Elections  (a) Any member who has rendered 15 years of creditable service and who has, prior to becoming a member of the System, served a minimum of one full year of full-time service in the military or one full year of full-time service as a member of the Cadet Nurse Corps in World War II, the Peace Corps, VISTA, or AmeriCorps for which the member has derived no military pension benefits, may elect to have included in the member's creditable service all or any part of the member's military, Cadet Nurse Corps, Peace Corps, VISTA, or AmeriCorps service not exceeding five years. Any member who so elects shall deposit in the Fund by a single contribution the amount or amounts determined by the System's actuary to be cost neutral to the System. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any member shall, upon application, be granted up to three years of credit for military service during the periods June 25, 1950, through January 31, 1955, February 28, 1961, through August 4, 1964, if service was performed in what is now the Republic of Vietnam, and August 5, 1964, through May 7, 1975, and shall not be required to make a contribution, provided the member has rendered 15 years of creditable service and, prior to becoming a member, served a minimum of one full year of full-time service in the military for which he or she has derived no military pension benefits. The provisions of this subsection shall also be available to State employees who are not members of the classified system and who elect to participate in the defined Contribution Retirement Plan under chapter 16A of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a conflict between the provisions of this subsection and the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 12736 concerning the counting of the same full-time military service toward both military and State pensions, the provisions of the U. S. Code shall control.  (b) Any member who rendered service in the capacity of an employee for another state, as defined by the Board, may elect to have included in the member's creditable service, all or part of any period of such service.

(c) Any member may elect to have included in the member's creditable service, years of service as a municipal employee or as a teacher in a public or private school, as defined by the Board. Any member who so elects shall deposit in the Fund by a single contribution the amount or amounts determined by the System's actuary to be cost neutral to the System. No application for credit under this subsection shall be granted if at the time of application, the member has a vested right to retirement benefits in another Retirement System based upon that service.  (d) Any member may elect to have included in the member's creditable service all or any part of the member's service as a permanent State employee for which the member received no credit. Any member who so elects shall deposit in the Fund by a single contribution the amount or amounts determined by the System's actuary to be cost neutral to the System. Any group F member may elect to increase his or her retirement allowance for years of service as a group E member prior to January 1, 1991, for 1-1/4 percent of average final compensation to 1-2/3 percent of average final compensation. A member making an election under this subdivision shall deposit in the Annuity Savings Fund by a single contribution an amount computed at regular interest to be sufficient to provide at normal retirement an annuity equal to 1-2/3 percent of the member's average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of service for which the member elects to increase his or her retirement allowance. Any group F member who is actively employed on June 30, 2007, and who was a member of the group B plan prior to June 30, 1998, may elect to convert some or all of his or her group B service to group C service. A member making an election to convert shall deposit in the Fund by a single contribution an amount computed by the actuary to pay for the additional liability incurred by the increase in benefits between the group B and the group C plan multiplied by the number of years of service which the member elects to convert.  (e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary and except for credit elected under subsection (a) of this section, a member may not elect more than a total of 10 years of creditable service under the provisions of this section, except that there shall be no limit to years of service in group E being converted under subsection (d) of this section.  (f) Any time a member is required to make a single contribution in connection with an election under this section, a member may, with the approval of the Board, contribute over a maximum of five years in installments of equal value. Those contributions shall become a part of the member's accumulated contribution and shall be treated for all purposes in the same manner as the contributions made under section 473 of this title. Any member who retires before completing payment as approved by the Board for the purchase of service under this section shall receive pro rata credit for service purchased before the date of retirement, but if the member so elects at the time of retirement, the member may pay as much in a single sum as is necessary to provide full credit at that time.  (g) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, no non-Vermont state employment credit elected under this section shall be considered as creditable service for purposes of attaining five years' vesting required for retirement allowance eligibility.  (h) When a member has a minimum of 25 years of creditable service, he or she may elect to purchase up to five years of additional service credit. A member who makes an election under this subsection shall deposit in the fund by a single contribution, an amount computed at regular interest to be sufficient to provide at normal retirement an annuity equal to 1-2/3 percent of the member's average final compensation multiplied by the number of years purchased.

Premiums for the plan shall be prorated between the retired member and the Retirement System pursuant to section 631 of this title.  (c) Premiums for coverage of retired members of the Group C plan and their dependents in the group medical benefit plan shall be prorated on the same basis as is provided for active employees by the current collective bargaining agreement for the nonmanagement unit. The amounts designated as the State's share of premium for the medical benefit plan and the total premium for group life insurance provided under subdivision (a)(2) of this section shall be paid by the Fund as an operating expense in accordance with subsection 473(d) of this title.  (d) After January 1, 2007, the State Treasurer may offer and administer a dental benefit plan for retired members, beneficiaries, eligible dependents, and eligible retirees of special affiliated groups and the dependents of members of those groups who are eligible for coverage in the State Employee Group Medical Benefit Plan. The Plan shall be separate and apart from any dental benefit plan offered to Vermont State employees. The original plan of benefits, and any changes thereto, shall be determined by the State Treasurer with due consideration of recommendations from the Retired Employees' Committee on Insurance established in section 636 of this title.  (1) For purposes of dental benefits, \"retired members\" shall include retired employees of the State who are receiving a retirement allowance from the Vermont State Retirement System. In addition, \"retired members\" shall include retired employees who are receiving a retirement allowance based upon their employment with the Vermont State Employees' Association, the Vermont State Employees' Credit Union, and the Vermont Council on the Arts, as long as they were covered under a group dental plan as active employees on their retirement date, and:  (A) they have at least 20 years' service with that employer; or  (B) have attained 62 years of age, and have at least 15 years' service with that employer.  (2) One hundred percent of the premiums for providing dental benefit coverage to retired members, beneficiaries, and eligible dependents shall be paid in full by retired members and beneficiaries and shall be deducted from each member's retirement allowance each month. Nothing in this subdivision creates a legal obligation on the part of the State to pay any portion of the premiums required to provide dental benefit coverage to retired members, dependents, beneficiaries, or other eligible participants.  (3) Dependent eligibility shall be determined in the manner applied to determinations for coverage in the State Employee Medical Benefit Plan.

The Retirement Board, after consultation with its actuary, shall establish reduced premium payment percentages that are as cost neutral to the Fund as possible.  (f) [Repealed.]  (g) A member of the Group F plan who is first included in the membership of the System on or after July 1, 2008, who separates from service prior to being eligible for retirement benefits under this chapter, who has at least 20 years of creditable service, and who participated in the group medical benefit plan at the time of separation from service shall have a one-time option at the time retirement benefits commence to reinstate the same level of coverage, in the group medical benefit plan provided by the State of Vermont for active State employees, that existed at the date of separation from service. Premiums for the plan shall be prorated between the retired member and the Retirement System pursuant to subsection 479(a) of this title.  (h) For purposes of entitlement to medical benefits in retirement, former county court employees hired by the counties to court positions on or before June 30, 2008 who became State employees on February 1, 2011 pursuant to 2010 Acts and Resolves No. 154 shall be deemed to have been first included in membership of the system on or before June 30, 2008.

This special accrued liability contribution, subject to such adjustment as may be necessary on account of any additional credits for service prior to the date of participation of its employees in the System awarded by such employer, shall be payable in lieu of the accrued liability contribution payable on account of other employees in the Vermont State Retirement System. The expense of making the valuation to determine any special accrued liability contribution shall be assessed against and paid by the employer on whose account it was necessary.

Default; paid up deferred annuity  The agreement of any employer to contribute on account of its employees shall be irrevocable, but should any employer for any reason become financially unable to make the contributions on account of its employees as provided in this subchapter, then such employer shall be deemed to be in default.

(b) Any person who is a member of a Retirement System as defined in subsection (a) of this section may transfer his or her membership to another Retirement System, as defined in subsection (a) of this section, within one year after acceptance of office or employment which makes it possible or mandatory for him or her to participate in such other Retirement System if such acceptance of office or employment would make it impossible for him or her to continue as a contributing member of the Retirement System of which he or she has been a member.  (c) Any such person desiring so to transfer membership shall notify the board of trustees of the retirement system of which the person is a member and the board of trustees of the retirement system to which the person wishes to transfer of such intention and shall request a transfer of the total amount of the accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in the fund of the system of which he or she is a member from said system to the retirement system to which he or she wishes to transfer his or her membership and shall request the deposit of such accumulated contributions in the fund of the system he or she intends to join. The amount to be transferred shall be the member's compensation multiplied by the actual fiscal year employer contribution rate that was in effect for each year of creditable service being transferred, plus any amount of contributions made by the member, if any. Upon transfer of membership and funds in accordance with the provisions of this section he or she shall receive credit in the system to which he or she has transferred for all accrued benefit rights based on service rendered prior to such transfer for which he or she was entitled to credit in the system from which he or she transferred.  (d) Upon becoming a member of the retirement system to which he or she has transferred, such person shall thereafter be eligible for such benefits or annuities as are provided by law in such retirement system, including the credits for previous service in the retirement system from which the person has transferred as provided in subsection (e) of this section. The average final compensation used to calculate the benefit payable at retirement shall be determined by using the earnable compensation which affords the highest consecutive years of earnings under either the system from which or to which he or she transferred. Except for the determination of the average final compensation as set forth in this subsection, the benefits for a member who transferred from one retirement system to another shall be calculated as follows:  (1) a member who transfers after July 1, 2007, and before June 30, 2008, shall have the option to have the service from the first system calculated according to the provisions of either the first or the second system at the time of retirement;  (2) a member who transfers on or before June 30, 2007, or on or after July 1, 2008, shall have his or her benefits calculated according to the provisions of the system or systems under which the benefits were accrued;  (3) when benefits calculated according to the provisions of two or more retirement systems are combined under this subsection, they may exceed the maximum percentage of average final compensation established for each plan.  (e) The Board of Trustees of the Vermont State Retirement System, the State Teachers' Retirement System of Vermont and the Municipal Employees' Retirement System are severally authorized to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.  (f) Such provisions of subchapter 1 of this chapter, 16 V.S.A. chapter 55 and 24 V.S.A. chapter 125 as are inconsistent with the provisions hereof are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.  (g) If any provision of this section, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this section, nor provisions or applications of the statutes to which this section is in addition which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are declared to be severable.

Where a vote is held according to Sections 218(d)(6)(C) and 218(d)(7) of the Social Security Act, the Retirement System shall be divided into two parts. One part, Part A, shall be composed of the positions of members who in such vote have expressed a desire to have their services in such positions included under the agreement and of the positions of all individuals who become members of such System after the agreement is extended to include the service of those members who have expressed a desire to be covered under the Social Security Act; and the other part, Part B, shall be composed of the positions of members who have not expressed a desire in such vote to have their services included under the agreement and the positions of any individual who was ineligible to be a member of such retirement system on August 1, 1956 or, if later, on the day he or she first occupied such position.

(b) Upon receiving evidence satisfactory to him or her that with respect to any such referendum or any such vote the conditions specified in Section 218(d)(3) or in Section 218(d)(7), respectively of the Social Security Act have been met, the Governor shall so certify to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  (c) Where a Retirement System covers positions of employees of the State and positions of employees of one or more political subdivisions of the State, or covers positions of employees of two or more political subdivisions of the State, then, for purposes of this section, there may, in accordance with a determination by the State agency, be deemed to be a separate Retirement System with respect to any one or more of the political subdivisions concerned and, where the Retirement System covers positions of employees of the State, a separate Retirement System with respect to the State or with respect to the State and any one or more of the political subdivisions concerned.

Examination of evidence by agency  When in a contested case a majority of the officials of the agency who are to render the final decision have not heard the case or read the record, the decision, if adverse to a party to the proceeding other than the agency itself, shall not be made until a proposal for decision is served upon the parties, and an opportunity is afforded to each party adversely affected to file exceptions and present briefs and oral argument to the officials who are to render the decision. The proposal for decision shall contain a statement of the reasons therefor and of each issue of fact or law necessary to the proposed decision, prepared by the person who conducted the hearing or one who has read the record. The parties by written stipulation may waive compliance with this section. (Added 1967, No. 360 (Adj. Sess.), 11, eff. July 1, 1969.)  812. Decisions and orders  (a) A final decision or order adverse to a party in a contested case shall be in writing or stated in the record. A final decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings. If, in accordance with agency rules, a party submitted proposed findings of fact, the decision shall include a ruling upon each proposed finding. Parties shall be notified forthwith either personally or by mail of any decision or order. A copy of the decision or order shall be delivered or mailed forthwith to each attorney of record and to each party not having an attorney of record.

Sess.), 13, eff. July 1, 1969.)  814. Licenses  (a) When the grant, denial, or renewal of a license is required to be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing, the provisions of this chapter concerning contested cases shall apply.  (b) When a licensee has made timely and sufficient application for the renewal of a license or a new license with reference to any activity of a continuing nature, the existing license does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency, and, in case the application is denied or the terms of the new license limited, until the last day for seeking review of the agency order or a later date fixed by order of the reviewing court.  (c) No revocation, suspension, annulment, or withdrawal of any license is lawful unless, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, the agency gave notice by mail to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and the licensee was given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license. If the agency finds that public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, summary suspension of a license may be ordered pending proceedings for revocation or other action. These proceedings shall be promptly instituted and determined.  (d) An agency having jurisdiction to conduct proceedings and impose sanctions in connection with conduct of a licensee or former licensee shall not lose jurisdiction if the license is not renewed or is surrendered or otherwise terminated prior to initiation of such proceedings.

Judicial review of contested cases  (a) A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in any contested case may appeal that decision to the Supreme Court, unless some other court is expressly provided by law. However, a preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling is immediately appealable under those rules if review of the final decision would not provide an adequate remedy, and the filing of the appeal does not itself stay enforcement of the agency decision. The agency may grant, or the reviewing court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms.  (b) If, before the date set for court hearing, application is made to the Court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the Court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon conditions determined by the Court. The agency may modify its findings and decisions by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.  (c) If the final decision of an agency is expressly provided by law to be reviewable in Superior Court or in the Supreme Court, such review shall be commenced by filing a notice of appeal pursuant to V.R.C.P. 74 or V.R.A.P. 13, as appropriate.

(Added 1981, No. 82, 6; amended 1995, No. 61, 1; 2001, No. 149 (Adj. Sess.), 48, eff. June 27, 2002; 2017, No. 156 (Adj. Sess.), 2.)  832. Exemptions; limitations  (a) No agency shall be required to adopt a procedure or rule:  (1) which may result in the disclosure of information considered by statute to be confidential;  (2) setting forth guidelines to be used by the staff of an agency in the performance of audits, investigations, inspections, in settling commercial disputes or negotiating commercial arrangements, or in the defense, prosecution, or settlement of cases, if the disclosure of the statement would:  (A) enable law violators to avoid detection;  (B) facilitate disregard of requirements imposed by law; or  (C) give a clearly improper advantage to persons who are in an adverse position to the state; or  (3) describing the content of an agency budget.  (b) Subsection 831(c) of this title does not require any agency to adopt rules:  (1) establishing specific prices to be charged for particular goods or services sold by an agency;  (2) concerning only the physical servicing, maintenance, or care of agency owned or operated facilities or property;  (3) relating only to the use of a particular facility or property owned, operated, or maintained by the State or any of its subdivisions, if the substance of that rule is adequately indicated by means of signs or signals to persons who use the facility or property;  (4) concerning only inmates of a correctional or detention facility, students enrolled in an educational institution, or patients admitted to a hospital, if adopted by that facility, institution, or hospital.  (c) Subsections 831(b) and (c) of this title do not require the Attorney General to adopt procedures or rules describing the content of opinions or other legal advice given to agencies.

Periodic review of rules and forms  (a) Upon written request to an agency by the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, a rule or part of a rule that has not been adopted, readopted or substantially amended during the preceding six years shall expire one year from the date of the request. However, this section does not prevent the agency from adopting the same or a similar rule during that year.  (b) The Secretary of State shall review all forms used by agencies and affecting members of the public and shall make recommendations for their simplification and consolidation.

On or after January 1, 2024, an agency shall not rely on a procedure or guidance document or cite it against any party to a proceeding, unless the procedure or guidance document is included in a compilation maintained and published in accordance with this subsection.  (b) A procedure or guidance document shall not have the force of law. However, this subsection shall not apply to a procedure if a statute that specifically enables the procedure states that it has the force of law.

(4) If an agency is a board or commission exercising quasi-judicial functions and members of the public can access all of the information required by subdivision (2) of this subsection through the agency's online case-management system, this information need not also be posted on the agency's website. Instead, the list of proposed rules on the agency's website shall include the case number for each proposed rule and instructions for accessing all of the information about the proposed rule in the agency's online case-management system. (Added 1981, No. 82, 6; amended 2017, No. 156 (Adj. Sess.), 2.)  837. Prefiling  Except for emergency rules, a rule shall be prefiled with the Interagency Committee on Administrative Rules 15 days before filing under section 838 of this title. (Added 1981, No. 82, 6; amended 2001, No. 149 (Adj. Sess.), 49, eff. June 27, 2002.)  838. Filing of proposed rules  (a) Filing; information. Proposed rules shall be filed with the Secretary of State in a format determined by the Secretary that includes the following information:  (1) The name of the agency and the subject or title of the rule.  (2) An analysis of economic impact.  (3) An analysis of environmental impact.  (4) An explanation of all material incorporated by reference, if any.  (5) The text of the proposed rule.  (6) An annotated text showing changes from existing rules. The annotated text of the rule shall include markings to indicate clearly changed wording from any existing rule.  (7) An explanation of the strategy for maximizing public input on the proposed rule as prescribed by the Interagency Committee on Administrative Rules.  (8) A brief summary of the scientific information upon which the proposed rule is based, to the extent the proposed rule depends on scientific information for its validity. The summary shall refer to the scientific studies on which the proposed rule is based and shall explain the procedure for obtaining such studies from the agency.  (9) A concise summary in plain language explaining the rule and its effect.  (10) The specific statutory authority for the rule, and, if none exists, the general statutory authority for the rule.  (11) An explanation of why the rule is necessary.  (12) An explanation of the people, enterprises, and government entities affected by the rule.  (13) The name, address, and telephone number of an individual in the agency able to answer questions and receive comments on the proposal.  (14) A proposed schedule for completing the requirements of this chapter, including, if there is a hearing scheduled, the date, time, and place of that hearing and a deadline for receiving comments.  (15) Whether the rule contains an exemption from inspection and copying of public records or otherwise contains a Public Records Act exemption by designating information as confidential or limiting its public release and, if so, the asserted statutory authority for the exemption and a brief summary of the reason for the exemption.  (16) A signed and dated statement by the adopting authority approving the contents of the filing.  (b) Economic impact analysis; rules affecting small businesses and school districts.  (1) General requirements. The economic impact analysis shall analyze the anticipated costs and benefits to be expected from adoption of the rule. Specifically, each economic impact analysis shall, for each requirement in the rule:  (A) list each category of people, enterprises, and government entities potentially affected and estimate for each the costs and benefits anticipated; and  (B) compare the economic impact of the rule with the economic impact of other alternatives to the rule, including having no rule on the subject or a rule having separate requirements for small businesses.  (2) Small businesses. When a rule provides for the regulation of a small business, in the economic impact analysis, the agency shall include, when appropriate, a specific and clearly demarcated evaluation of ways by which a small business can reduce the cost and burden of compliance by specifying less numerous, detailed, or frequent reporting requirements or alternative methods of compliance. When an agency determines that such an evaluation is not appropriate, the economic impact statement shall briefly explain the reasons for this determination.  (A) An agency shall also include in this evaluation its consideration of creative, innovative, or flexible methods of compliance with the rule when the agency finds, in writing, that these methods of compliance would not:  (i) significantly reduce the effectiveness of the rule in achieving the objectives or purposes of the statutes being implemented or interpreted; or  (ii) be inconsistent with the language or purpose of statutes that are implemented or interpreted by the rule; or  (iii) increase the risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the public or to the beneficiaries of the regulation or compromise the environmental standards of the State.  (B) This subdivision (2) shall not apply when the regulation is incidental to:  (i) a purchase of goods or services by the State or an agency thereof; or  (ii) the payment for goods or services by the State or an agency thereof for the benefit of a third party.  (3) School districts. If a rule affects or provides for the regulation of public education and public schools, the economic impact analysis shall include a specific and clearly demarcated evaluation of the cost implications to local school districts and school taxpayers and shall clearly state the associated costs. This evaluation also shall include consideration of alternatives to the rule, including having no rule on the subject, that would reduce or ameliorate costs to local school districts while achieving the objectives or purposes of the proposed rule.  (4) Most appropriate method. In addition, each economic impact analysis shall conclude that the rule is the most appropriate method of achieving the regulatory purpose. Only employees of the agency and information either already available to the agency or available at reasonable cost need be used in preparing economic impact analyses.  (c) Environmental impact analysis. The environmental impact analysis shall:  (1) Analyze the anticipated environmental impacts, whether positive or negative, from adoption of the rule. Examples of environmental impacts include the emission of greenhouse gases; the discharge of pollutants to water; and effects on the ability of the environment to provide benefits such as food and fresh water, regulation of climate and water flow, and recreation.  (2) Compare the environmental impact of the rule with the environmental impact of other alternatives to the rule, including having no rule on the subject.  (d) Incorporation by reference.  (1) A rule may incorporate by reference all or any part of a code, standard, or rule that has been adopted by an agency of the United States, this State, or another state or by a nationally recognized organization or association, if:  (A) repeating verbatim the text of the code, standard, or rule in the rule would be unduly cumbersome, expensive, or otherwise inexpedient; and  (B) the reference in the rule fully identifies the incorporated code, standard, or rule by citation, date, and place where copies are available.  (2) Materials incorporated by reference shall be readily available to the public. As used in this subsection, \"readily available\" means that all of the following apply:  (A) Each filing states where copies of the incorporated code, standard, or rule are available in written or electronic form from the agency adopting the rule or the agency of the United States, this State, another state, or the organization or association originally issuing the code, standard, or rule.  (B) A copy of the code, standard, or rule is made available for public inspection at the principal office of the agency, and is available at that office for copying in the manner set forth in 1 V.S.A. 316 and subject to the exceptions set forth in 1 V.S.A. 317(c).  (C) The incorporated code, standard, or rule is made available for free public access online unless the agency is prevented from providing such access by law or legally enforceable contract.

(d) Reimbursement. The Secretary of State shall be reimbursed by agencies making publication in accordance with subsection (c) of this section so that all costs are prorated among agencies publishing at the same time.

Public hearing and comment  (a) The agency may hold one or more public hearings for each proposed rule. A public hearing shall be scheduled if so requested by 25 persons, by a governmental subdivision or agency, by the Interagency Committee on Administrative Rules, or by an association having 25 or more members. The first hearing shall not be held sooner than 30 days following the notice required by section 839 of this title.  (b) On request, the agency shall promptly provide a copy of a proposed or final proposed rule. If the copy is mailed, it shall be sent not later than the end of the third working day after the request is received. The agency may charge for copying costs in the amount provided by law.  (c) An agency shall afford all persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views or arguments, orally or in writing, at least through the seventh day following the last public hearing.  (d) The agency shall consider fully all written and oral submissions concerning the proposed rule, and all submissions on separate requirements for small businesses. The agency shall provide information to all individuals, who submitted written or oral comment, on the procedure for adoption of rules and how to obtain changes in the proposed rule.  (e) If requested by an interested person at any time before 30 days after final adoption of a rule, the adopting authority shall issue an explanation of the proposed rule. The explanation shall include:  (1) a concise statement of the principal reasons for and against the adoption of the rule in its final form; and  (2) an explanation of why the adopting authority overruled the arguments and considerations against the rule. (Added 1981, No. 82, 6; amended 1985, No. 56, 4; 1999, No. 146 (Adj. Sess.), 5; 2009, No. 146 (Adj. Sess.), F3.)  841. Final proposal  (a) After considering public comment as required in section 840 of this title, an agency shall file a final proposal with the Secretary of State and with the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules. The Committee may require that the agency include an electronic copy of the final proposal with its filing.  (b) The filing of the final proposal shall include all information required to be filed with the original proposal, suitably amended to reflect any changes made in the rule and the fact that public hearing and comment have been completed.  (1) With the final proposal, the agency shall include a statement that succinctly and separately addresses each of the following:  (A) how the proposed rule is within the authority of the agency;  (B) why the proposed rule is not arbitrary;  (C) the strategy for maximizing public input that was prescribed by the Interagency Committee on Administrative Rules and the actions taken by the agency that demonstrate compliance with that strategy;  (D) the sufficiency of the economic impact analysis; and  (E) the sufficiency of the environmental impact analysis.  (2) When an agency decides in a final proposal to overrule substantial arguments and considerations raised for or against the original proposal or to reject suggestions with respect to separate requirements for small businesses, the final proposal shall include a description of the reasons for the agency's decision.  (c) The Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules shall distribute a copy of the final proposal to:  (1) the chairs of the appropriate standing committees;  (2) each member of the appropriate standing committees who requests a copy of the filing; and  (3) the Chairs of the House and Senate Committees on Government Operations, if the cover sheet accompanying the filing identifies a Public Records Act exemption in the rule.  (d) The chair of a standing committee that considered legislation delegating rulemaking authority and, in the case of rules that create or enlarge the scope of a Public Records Act exemption, the Chairs of the House and Senate Committees on Government Operations, may convene the committee for the purpose of considering a recommended course of action for the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules. The chair may convene such a meeting, pursuant to 2 V.S.A. 23, while the General Assembly is not in session. Any recommended course of action shall be filed with the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules no later than five working days before the Committee has scheduled a review of the proposed rule. (Added 1981, No. 82, 6; amended 1985, No. 56, 5; 1989, No. 134 (Adj. Sess.); 1999, No. 146 (Adj. Sess.), 6; 2001, No. 149 (Adj. Sess.), 51, eff. June 27, 2002; 2015, No. 3, 2; 2017, No. 156 (Adj. Sess.), 2.)  842. Review by Legislative Committee  (a) Objection; time frame; process.  (1) Within 45 days after the filing of a final proposal unless the agency consents to an extension of this review period, the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, by majority vote of the entire Committee, may object under subsection (b) of this section and recommend that the agency amend or withdraw the proposal. The agency shall be notified promptly of the objections. Failure to give timely notice shall be deemed approval.  (2) The agency shall within 14 days after receiving notice respond in writing to the Committee and send a copy to the Secretary of State. In its response, the agency may include revisions to the proposed rule or filing documents that seek to cure defects noted by the Committee.  (3) After receipt of this response, the Committee may withdraw or modify its objections.  (b) Grounds for objection. The Committee may object under this subsection if:  (1) a proposed rule is beyond the authority of the agency;  (2) a proposed rule is contrary to the intent of the Legislature;  (3) a proposed rule is arbitrary;  (4) the agency did not adhere to the strategy for maximizing public input prescribed by the Interagency Committee on Administrative Rules;  (5) a proposed rule is not written in a satisfactory style in accordance with section 833 of this title;  (6) the economic impact analysis fails to recognize a substantial economic impact of the proposed rule, fails to include an evaluation and statement of costs to local school districts required under section 838 of this title, or fails to recognize a substantial economic impact of the rule to such districts; or  (7) the environmental impact analysis fails to recognize a substantial environmental impact of the proposed rule.  (c) Objections; legal effect.  (1) When objection is made under this section, and the objection is not withdrawn after the agency responds, on majority vote of the entire Committee, it may file the objection in certified form with the Secretary of State. The objection shall contain a concise statement of the Committee's reasons for its action. The Secretary shall affix to each objection a certification of its filing and as soon as practicable transmit a copy to the agency.  (2) After a Committee objection is filed with the Secretary under this subsection, or on the same grounds under subsection 817(d) of this title, to the extent that the objection covers a rule or portion of a rule, the burden of proof thereafter shall be on the agency in any action for judicial review or for enforcement of the rule to establish that the part objected to is within the authority delegated to the agency, is consistent with the intent of the Legislature, is not arbitrary, and is written in a satisfactory style in accordance with section 833 of this title, and that the agency did adhere to the strategy for maximizing public input prescribed by the Interagency Committee on Administrative Rules and its economic and environmental impact analyses did not fail to recognize a substantial economic or environmental impact. The objection of the Committee shall not be admissible evidence in any proceeding other than to establish the fact of the objection. If the agency fails to meet its burden of proof, the court shall declare the whole or portion of the rule objected to invalid.  (3) The failure of the Committee to object to a rule is not an implied legislative authorization of its substantive or procedural lawfulness.  (d) Notice of objection; inclusion on rule copies. When an objection is made under subsection (b) of this section and has been certified by the Secretary of State, notice of the objection shall be included on all copies of the rule distributed to the public. (Added 1981, No. 82, 6; amended 1981, No. 158 (Adj. Sess.), 1; 1999, No. 9, 1, eff. May 4, 1999; 2001, No. 149 (Adj. Sess.), 52, eff. June 27, 2002; 2017, No. 156 (Adj. Sess.), 2; 2019, No. 12, 1, eff. April 30, 2019.)  843. Filing of adopted rules  (a) An adopting authority may adopt a properly filed final proposed rule after:  (1) The passage of 45 days after filing of a final proposal under section 841 of this title, provided the agency has not received notice of objection from the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules;  (2) Receiving notice of approval from the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules; or  (3) Responding to an objection of the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules under section 842 of this title. After responding to such an objection, an agency may adopt the rule without change or may make a germane change in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.  (b) The text of the adopted rule shall be the same as the text of the final proposed rule submitted under section 841, except that any germane change may be made by the agency in response to an objection or expressed concern of the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules.  (c) Adoption shall be complete upon proper filing with the Secretary of State and with the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules. An agency shall have eight months from the date of initial filing with the Secretary of State to adopt a rule unless extended by action or request of the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules. The Secretary of State shall refuse to accept a final filing after that date, except that:  (1) Within 30 days after discovering that the text of a final adopted rule deviates from the text of a final proposed rule as approved by the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, an agency shall correct the adopted rule to conform to the final proposed rule as so approved and shall refile the adopted rule in the manner set forth in this section, along with documentation demonstrating that the refiled adopted rule conforms to the final proposed rule as approved.  (2) An agency may refile a final adopted rule in the manner set forth in this section solely for the purpose of correcting one or more typographic errors that do not change the substance or effect of the rule.  (d) Adopted rules filed shall include:  (1) A cover sheet on a form prepared by the Secretary of State containing at least the following information:  (A) the name of the agency;  (B) the title or subject of the rule;  (C) a brief summary of any changes made since the filing of the final proposed rule, including any changes in expected economic impact;  (D) a summary of the dates on which the agency complied with the procedural requirements of this chapter; and  (E) a signed and dated statement by the adopting authority that the procedural requirements of this chapter have been met and that the adopting authority approves of the contents of the filing; and  (2) An adopting page as required by section 838 of this title; and  (3) The text of the rule.  (e) After adopting a rule, the agency shall create a file containing all papers used or created in that action. The file shall be retained for at least one year. (Added 1981, No. 82, 6; amended 1983, No. 202 (Adj. Sess.), 1, eff. April 26, 1984; 1999, No. 9, 2, eff. May 4, 1999; 2017, No. 156 (Adj. Sess.), 2; 2019, No. 12, 1, eff. April 30, 2019.)  844. Emergency rules  (a) Where an agency believes that there exists an imminent peril to public health, safety, or welfare, it may adopt an emergency rule. The rule may be adopted without having been prefiled or filed in proposed or final proposed form, and may be adopted after whatever notice and hearing the agency finds to be practicable under the circumstances. The agency shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that emergency rules are known to persons who may be affected by them.  (b) Emergency rules adopted under this section shall not remain in effect for more than 180 days. An agency may propose a permanent rule on the same subject at the same time that it adopts an emergency rule.  (c) Emergency rules adopted under this section shall be filed with the Secretary of State and with the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules. The Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules shall distribute copies of emergency rules to the appropriate standing committees.  (d) Emergency rules adopted under this section shall include:  (1) as much of the information required for the filing of a proposed rule as is practicable under the circumstances; and  (2) a signed and dated statement by the adopting authority explaining the nature of the imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare and approving of the contents of the rules.  (e)(1) On a majority vote of the entire Committee, the Committee may object under this subsection if an emergency rule is:  (A) beyond the authority of the agency;  (B) contrary to the intent of the Legislature;  (C) arbitrary; or  (D) not necessitated by an imminent peril to public health, safety, or welfare sufficient to justify adoption of an emergency rule.  (2) When objection is made under this subsection, on majority vote of the entire Committee, the Committee may file the objection in certified form with the Secretary of State. The objection shall contain a concise statement of the Committee's reasons for its action. The Secretary shall affix to each objection a certification of its filing and as soon as practicable transmit a copy to the agency. After a Committee objection is filed with the Secretary under this subsection, to the extent that the objection covers a rule or portion of a rule, the burden of proof thereafter shall be on the agency in any action for judicial review or for enforcement of the rule to establish that the part objected to is within the authority delegated to the agency, is consistent with the intent of the Legislature, is not arbitrary, and is justified by an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare. If the agency fails to meet its burden of proof, the court shall declare the whole or portion of the rule objected to invalid. The failure of the Committee to object to a rule is not an implied legislative authorization of its substantive or procedural lawfulness.  (3) When the Committee makes an objection to an emergency rule under this subsection, the agency may withdraw the rule to which an objection was made. Prior to withdrawal, the agency shall give notice to the Committee of its intent to withdraw the rule. A rule shall be withdrawn upon the filing of a notice of withdrawal with the Secretary of State and the Committee. If the emergency rule amended an existing rule, upon withdrawal of the emergency rule, the existing rule shall revert to its original form, as though the emergency rule had never been adopted.  (f) In response to an expressed concern of the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, an agency may make a germane change to an emergency rule that is approved by the Committee. A change under this subsection shall not be considered a newly adopted emergency rule and shall not extend the period during which the emergency rule remains in effect.  (g) In the alternative to the grounds specified in subsection (a) of this section, an agency may adopt emergency amendments to existing rules using the process set forth in this section if each of the subdivisions (1)-(5) of this subsection applies. On a majority vote of the entire Committee, the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules may object to the emergency amendments on the basis that one or more of these subdivisions do not apply or under subdivision (e)(1)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, or both.  (1) The existing rules implement a program controlled by federal statute or rule or by a multistate entity.  (2) The controlling federal statute or rule has been amended to require a change in the program or the multistate entity has made a change in the program that is to be implemented in all of the participating states.

Powers and duties  (a) [Repealed.]  (b) In all proceedings under this chapter, no evidence shall be admitted or considered that relates to conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations, including mediation, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. This subsection does not require exclusion of evidence otherwise obtainable from independent sources because it was presented in the course of compromise negotiations nor does it require exclusion of evidence offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness, negating a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct an investigation.  (c) Until a transcript of the record in a case is filed in a court under this chapter, the Board at any time upon reasonable notice and in such manner as it considers proper may modify or set aside wholly or partially a finding made or order issued by it.  (d) The Board may appoint a mediator to assist in resolving differences.  (e) In addition to its responsibilities under this chapter, the Board shall carry out the responsibilities given to it under 21 V.S.A. chapters 19 and 22 and chapter 28 of this title and when so doing shall exercise the powers and follow the procedures set out in that chapter.

Mediation; fact finding  (a) Whenever the representatives of a collective bargaining unit and the representative of the employer, after a reasonable period of negotiation reach an impasse during the course of collective bargaining on subjects defined in section 904 of this title, the Board, upon petition of either or both parties, may authorize the parties to submit their differences to mediation. The Board shall within five days appoint a mediator who shall communicate with the employer and the employees or their representatives and endeavor by mediation to obtain an amicable settlement. Any mediator so appointed shall be a person of high standing in no way actively connected with labor or management.  (b) If after a reasonable period of time not less than 15 days after the appointment of a mediator the impasse is not resolved, the mediator shall certify to the Board that the impasse continues. The Board shall appoint a fact finder mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties do not agree, the Board may appoint a neutral third party to act as fact finder pursuant to rules adopted by the Board.  (c) [Repealed.]  (d) The fact finder shall conduct hearings, pursuant to rules established by the Board. Upon request of either party or of the fact finder, the Board may issue subpoenas of persons and documents for the hearings and the fact finder may require that testimony be given under oath and may administer oaths.  (e) Nothing herein shall prohibit a fact finder from endeavoring to mediate the dispute, which the fact finder is considering, at any time prior to the issuance of recommendations.  (f) The fact finder shall consider, if applicable to the issues, the following factors, among others, in making a recommendation:  (1) wage and salary schedules and employee benefits to the extent they are inconsistent with prevailing rates both internally and in commerce and industry for comparable work within the State;  (2) work schedules relating to assigned hours and days of the week as they relate to the employee's needs and the general public's requirement for continual service;  (3) general working conditions as they compare with generally accepted safety standards and conditions prevailing in commerce and industry within the State.  (g) Upon completion of the hearings, the fact finder shall make and file with both parties written findings and recommendations.  (h) The costs of witnesses and other expenses incurred by either party in fact-finding proceedings shall be paid directly by the party incurring them, and the costs and expenses of the fact finder shall be divided equally between the parties. Each party shall make payment of its half of the total to the fact finder within 15 days after receipt of the fact finder's bill.  (i)(1) In the case of the Vermont State Colleges or the University of Vermont, if the dispute remains unresolved 20 days after transmittal of findings and recommendations to the parties or within a time frame mutually agreed upon by the parties that may be not more than an additional 30 days, each party shall submit as a single package its last best offer on all disputed issues to the Board. Each party's last best offer shall be filed with the Board under seal and shall be unsealed and placed in the public record only when both parties' last best offers are filed with the Board. The Board shall hold one or more hearings. Within 30 days of the certifications, the Board shall select between the last best offers of the parties, considered in their entirety without amendment.  (2) In the case of the State of Vermont or the Department of State's Attorneys and Sheriffs, if the dispute remains unresolved 20 days after transmittal of findings and recommendations to the parties or within a time frame mutually agreed upon by the parties that may be not more than an additional 30 days, each party shall submit as a single package its last best offer on all disputed issues to the Board, or upon the request of either party, to an arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the American Arbitration Association shall appoint a neutral third party to act as arbitrator. Each party's last best offer shall be filed with the Board or the arbitrator under seal and shall be unsealed and placed in the public record only when both parties' last best offers are filed with the Board or the arbitrator. The Board or the arbitrator shall hold one or more hearings. Within 30 days of the certifications, the Board or the arbitrator shall select between the last best offers of the parties, considered in their entirety without amendment.  (j) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) of this section:  (1) In the case of the Vermont State Colleges or the University of Vermont, should the Board find the last best offers of both parties unreasonable and likely to produce undesirable results, or likely to result in a long-lasting negative impact upon the parties' collective bargaining relationship, then the Board may select the recommendation of the fact finder under subsection (g) of this section as to those disputed issues submitted to the Board in the last best offers.  (2) In the case of the State of Vermont or the Department of State's Attorneys and Sheriffs, should the Board or the arbitrator find the last best offers of both parties unreasonable and likely to produce undesirable results, or likely to result in a long-lasting negative impact upon the parties' collective bargaining relationship, then the Board or the arbitrator may select the recommendation of the fact finder under subsection (g) of this section as to those disputed issues submitted to the Board or the arbitrator in the last best offers.  (k)(1) In the case of the University of Vermont or the Vermont State Colleges, the decision of the Board shall be final and binding on each party.  (2) In the case of the State of Vermont or the Department of State's Attorneys and Sheriffs, the decision of the Board or the arbitrator shall be final, and the terms of the chosen agreement shall be binding on each party, subject to appropriations in accordance with subsection 982(d) of this title.  (l) Nothing herein shall be construed to permit an arbitrator or the Board to issue an order under subsection (i) of this section binding upon the parties that is in conflict with any statute or any rule or regulation that is not bargainable.

Grievances  (a) The Board shall hear and make a final determination on the grievances of all employees who are eligible to appeal grievances to the Board. Grievance hearings at the Board level shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Board. The right to institute grievance proceedings extends to individual employees, groups of employees, and collective bargaining units.  (b) A collective bargaining agreement may provide for binding arbitration as a final step of a grievance procedure, rather than a hearing by the Board. An agreement that includes a binding arbitration provision shall also include the procedure for selecting an arbitrator.  (c) If a collective bargaining agreement provides for binding arbitration as a final step of a grievance procedure, the agreement may also establish:  (1) procedural rules for conducting grievance arbitration proceedings;  (2) whether grievance arbitration proceedings will be confidential; and  (3) whether arbitrated grievance determinations will have precedential value.  (d) An arbitrator chosen or appointed under this section shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or modify the collective bargaining agreement.  (e) Any collective bargaining agreement that contains a binding arbitration provision pursuant to this section shall include an acknowledgement of arbitration that provides substantially the following:    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ARBITRATION    (The parties) understand that this agreement contains a provision for binding arbitration as a final step of the grievance process. After the effective date of this agreement, no grievance, submitted to binding arbitration, may be brought to the Vermont Labor Relations Board. An employee who has declined representation by the employee organization or whom the employee organization has declined to represent or is unable to represent, shall be entitled, either by representing himself or herself or with the assistance of independent legal counsel, to appeal his or her grievance to the Vermont Labor Relations Board as the final step of the grievance process in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Board.  (f) This section shall not apply to labor interest arbitration, which as used in this chapter means the method of concluding labor negotiations by means of a disinterested person to determine the terms of a labor agreement.  (g) A party may apply to the arbitrator for a modification of an award if the application is made within 30 days after delivery of a copy of the award to the applicant. An arbitrator may modify an award only if the arbitrator finds any one of the following:  (1) There was an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award.  (2) The award was based on a matter not submitted to the arbitrator, and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision on the issues submitted.  (3) The award was imperfect in form and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the controversy.  (h) A party may apply to the Civil Division of the Superior Court for review of the award provided the application is made within 30 days after delivery of a copy of the award to the applicant or, in the case of a claim of corruption, fraud, or other undue means, the application is made within 30 days after those grounds are known or should have been known. The Civil Division of the Superior Court shall vacate an arbitration award based on any of the following:  (1) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means.  (2) There was partiality or prejudicial misconduct by the arbitrator.  (3) The arbitrator exceeded his or her power or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by law.  (i) The Board shall hear and make a final determination on the grievances of all retired individual employees of the University of Vermont, groups of such retired individuals, and retired collective bargaining unit members of the University of Vermont. Grievances shall be limited to those relating to compensation and benefits that were accrued during active employment but are received after retirement. As used in this subsection, \"grievance\" means an allegation of a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, employee handbook provision, early retirement plan, individual separation agreement or other documented agreement, or rule or regulation of the University of Vermont.

Appropriate unit  (a) The Board shall decide the unit appropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining in each case and those employees to be included therein, in order to assure the employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this chapter.  (b) In determining whether a unit is appropriate under subsection (a) of this section, the extent to which the employees have organized is not controlling.  (c) The Board may decline recognition to any group of employees as a collective bargaining unit if, upon investigation and hearing, it is satisfied that the employees will not constitute an appropriate unit for purposes of collective bargaining or if recognition will result in over-fragmentation of state employee collective bargaining units. In case such a determination is made, the provisions of subchapter 3 of this chapter shall not become operative in that instance. (Added 1969, No. 113, 1.)  928. Rules  (a) The Board, as necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter, shall adopt and may amend and rescind rules consistent with this chapter.  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, rules adopted by the Board as they relate to grievance appeals shall provide:  (1) If a collective bargaining agreement provides that an appeal to the Board will constitute the final step in the grievance procedure, all employees and other persons authorized by this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the Board in accordance with the rules of the Board.  (2) That a reasonable notice be given to the State agency or officer, and State employee, and the representative concerned and to the Commissioner of Human Resources.  (3) That all hearings of the Board shall be public and, unless both parties concerned request that it be formal, hearings shall be informal and not subject to the rules of pleadings, procedure, and evidence of the courts of the State.  (4) That all parties in interest to any appeal shall be entitled to be heard on any matter at issue.  (5) That in appeals from the decisions of the Department of Human Resources or any State agency or officer, the State agency and officer and the State employee shall be parties in interest, and the Commissioner of Human Resources or the collective bargaining representative on motion, may intervene as a party in interest.  (6) That the parties at interest shall have the right to present witnesses, give evidence, and examine witnesses before the Board.  (7)(A)(i) That the name of any grievant whom the Board exonerates of misconduct for which he or she was disciplined shall be redacted from the version of the Board's decision that is posted on the Board's website.  (ii) Nothing in this subdivision (7)(A) shall be construed to require the Board to redact the name of the grievant from any other version of the Board's decision or from any other documents related to the grievance.  (B) Nothing in this subdivision (7) shall be construed to modify an individual's right to privacy pursuant to any law, rule, or policy. (Added 1969, No. 113, 1; amended 1977, No. 109, 8, eff.

      "Subchapter 3: Certification Procedure": "941. Unit determination, certification, and representation  (a) The Board shall determine issues of unit determination, certification, and representation in accordance with this chapter.  (b) No bargaining unit or collective bargaining representative shall be recognized by the employer until the Board has determined the appropriate unit to be represented and has formally certified its determination.  (c)(1) A petition may be filed with the Board, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Board by an employee or group of employees, or any individual or employee organization purporting to act on their behalf, alleging by filing a petition or petitions bearing signatures of not less than 30 percent of the employees that they wish to form a bargaining unit and be represented for collective bargaining, or that the individual or employee organization currently certified as the bargaining agent is no longer supported by at least 51 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit, or that they are now included in an approved bargaining unit and wish to form a separate bargaining unit under Board criteria for purposes of collective bargaining. The employee, group of employees, individual, or employee organization that files the petition, shall, at the same time that the petition is filed with the Board, provide a copy of the petition to the employer and, if appropriate, the current bargaining agent.  (2)(A)(i) An employer shall, not more than seven business days after receiving a copy of the petition, file any objections to the appropriateness of the proposed bargaining unit and raise any other unit determination issues with the Board and provide a copy of the filing to the employee, group of employees, individual, or employee organization that filed the petition.  (ii) A hearing shall be held before the Board pursuant to subdivision (d)(1)(B) of this section in the event the employer challenges the appropriateness of the proposed bargaining unit, provided that a hearing shall not be held if the parties stipulate to the composition of the appropriate bargaining unit and resolve any other unit determination issues before the hearing.  (iii) The Board may endeavor to informally mediate any dispute regarding the appropriateness of the proposed bargaining unit prior to the hearing.  (B)(i) Within five business days after receiving a copy of the petition, the employer shall file with the Board and the employee or group of employees, or the individual or employee organization purporting to act on their behalf, a list of the names and job titles of the employees in the proposed bargaining unit. To the extent possible, the list of employees shall be in alphabetical order by last name and provided in electronic format.  (ii) An employee or group of employees, or any person purporting to act on their behalf, that is seeking to demonstrate that the current bargaining agent is no longer supported by at least 51 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit shall not be entitled to obtain a list of the employees in the bargaining unit from the employer pursuant to this subdivision (c)(2)(B), but may obtain a list pursuant to subdivision (e)(3) of this section after the Board has investigated its petition and determined that a secret ballot election shall be conducted.  (iii) The list shall be kept confidential and shall be exempt from copying and inspection under the Public Records Act.  (d) The Board, a Board member, or a person or persons designated by the Board shall investigate the petition and do one of the following:  (1) Determine that the petition has made a sufficient showing of interest pursuant to subdivision (c)(1) of this section.  (2)(A) If it finds reasonable cause to believe that a question of unit determination or representation exists, the Board shall schedule a hearing to be held before the Board not more than ten business days after the petition was filed with the Board.  (B) Once scheduled, the date of the hearing shall not be subject to change except as provided pursuant to subdivision (e)(4) of this section.  (C) Hearing procedure and notification of the results of the hearing shall be in accordance with rules adopted by the Board, except that the parties shall only be permitted to submit posthearing briefs within not more than five business days after the hearing if the parties mutually agree to do so or if the Board requests that the parties submit posthearing briefs.  (D) The Board shall issue its decision as soon as practicable and, in any event, not more than five business days after the hearing or the submission any posthearing briefs.  (3) If the Board finds an absence of substantive evidence, it shall dismiss the petition.  (e)(1) Whenever, on the basis of a petition pursuant to subdivision (d)(1) of this section or a hearing pursuant to subdivision (d)(2) of this section, the Board finds substantial interest among employees in forming a bargaining unit or being represented for purposes of collective bargaining, a secret ballot election shall be conducted by the Board not more than 23 business days after the petition is filed with the Board except as otherwise provided pursuant to subdivision (4) of this subsection.  (2) The election shall be conducted so that it shows separately the wishes of the employees in the voting group involved as to the determination of the collective bargaining unit, including the right not to be organized. The collective bargaining unit or collective bargaining representative shall be recognized and certified by the Board upon a majority vote of the employees voting.  (3)(A) The employer shall file with the Board and the other parties a list of the employees in the bargaining unit within two business days after the Board determines that a secret ballot election shall be conducted.  (B) The list shall include, as appropriate, each employee's name, work location, shift, job classification, and contact information. As used in this subdivision (3), \"contact information\" includes an employee's home address, personal e-mail address, and home and personal cellular telephone numbers to the extent that the employer is in possession of such information.  (C) To the extent possible, the list of employees shall be in alphabetical order by last name and provided in electronic format.  (D) The list shall be:  (i) kept confidential by the Board and all of the parties; and  (ii) shall be exempt from copying and inspection under the Public Records Act.  (E) Failure to file the list within the time required pursuant to subdivision (A) of this subdivision (3) may be grounds for the Board to set aside the results of the election if an objection is filed within the time required pursuant to the Board's rules.  (4) The Board may, upon the request of any party or on its own motion, extend any time period set forth in this subsection or in subsections (c) and (d) of this section for good cause, provided that the election shall be conducted, or, in the event of a mail ballot election, that ballots are mailed to the employees, within not more than 60 calendar days after the date the petition is filed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The Board may further extend the time to conduct the election by not more than 30 additional calendar days upon the mutual agreement of the parties or if it determines that extraordinary circumstances have made such an extension necessary.  (f) In determining the appropriateness of a collective bargaining unit, the Board shall take into consideration but not be limited to the following criteria:  (1) The authority of governmental officials at the unit level to take positive action on matters subject to negotiation.  (2) The similarity or divergence of the interests, needs, and general conditions of employment of the employees to be represented. The Board may, in its discretion, require that a separate vote be taken among any particular class or type of employees within a proposed unit to determine specifically if the class or type wishes to be included.  (3) Whether over-fragmentation of units among State employees will result from certification to a degree which is likely to produce an adverse effect either on effective representation of State employees generally, or upon the efficient operation of State government.  (g)(1) In determining the representation of State employees in a collective bargaining unit, the Board shall conduct a secret ballot of the employees within the time period set forth in subdivision (e)(1) of this section, unless the time to conduct the election is extended pursuant to subdivision (e)(4) of this section, and certify the results to the interested parties and to the State employer. The original ballot shall be so prepared as to permit a vote against representation by anyone named on the ballot. No representative will be certified with less than a majority of the votes cast by employees in the bargaining unit.  (2) If in such election none of the choices receive a majority of the votes cast, a runoff election shall be conducted, the ballot providing for a selection between two choices receiving the largest and second largest number of valid votes cast in the original election.  (3) The Board's certification of the results of any election shall be conclusive as to findings unless reviewed under proceedings instituted for the prevention of prohibited practices in section 965 of this title.  (h) A representative chosen by secret ballot for the purposes of collective bargaining by a majority of the votes cast shall be the exclusive representative of all the employees in such unit for a minimum of one year. Such representative shall be eligible for reelection.  (i) The Board, by rule, shall prescribe a uniform procedure for the resolution of employee grievances submitted through the collective bargaining machinery. If the collective bargaining agreement does not provide that binding arbitration will be the final step of the negotiated grievance procedure pursuant to section 926 of this chapter, the final step of the negotiated grievance procedure, if required, shall be a hearing and final determination by the Board. Grievance hearings conducted by the Board shall be informal and not subject to the rules of pleading procedure, and evidence of the courts of the State. Any employee or group of employees included in a duly certified bargaining unit may be represented before the Board by its bargaining representative's counsel or designated executive staff employees or by any individual the Board may permit at its discretion.  (j) Any individual employee or group of employees shall have the right at any time to present complaints to their employer informally, and to have such complaints considered in good faith with or without the intervention of the bargaining representative. Adjustments shall not be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining contract or agreement then in effect. All such complaints shall be considered and a decision formulated and the complainant informed thereof within 15 days of presentment.  (k) Nothing in this chapter requires an individual to seek the assistance of his or her collective bargaining unit or its representative(s) in any grievance proceeding. He or she may represent himself or herself or be represented by counsel of his or her own choice or may avail himself or herself of the unit representative in grievance proceedings.

Election conduct  Any interested person may file with the Board a charge that employees eligible to vote in an election under this chapter have been coerced or restrained in the exercise of this right. The Board shall investigate and conduct hearings into the validity of the charge.

(2) An acknowledgment of arbitration that provides substantially the following:  ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ARBITRATION.  (The parties) understand that this agreement contains an agreement that the final step of the grievance process shall be binding arbitration. After the effective date of this agreement no grievance may be brought to the Vermont Labor Relations Board and no lawsuit concerning any grievance may be brought, unless it involves a question of constitutional or civil rights.  (c) This section shall not apply to labor interest arbitration, which for the purposes of this chapter means the method of concluding labor negotiations by means of a disinterested person to determine the terms of a labor agreement.  (d) A party may apply to the arbitrator for a modification of an award if the application is made within 30 days after delivery of a copy of an award to the applicant.

(2) The award was based on a matter not submitted to the arbitrator, and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision on the issues submitted.  (3) The award is imperfect in form and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the controversy.  (e) A party may apply to the Superior Court for review of the award provided the application is made within 30 days after delivery of a copy of the award to the applicant or, in case of a claim of corruption, fraud, or other undue means, the application is made within 30 days after those grounds are known or should have been known.

(3) The arbitrator exceeded his or her power or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by law.

The mediator may not be a person who has served as a mediator at an earlier stage of the same proceedings.  (c) The mediator shall encourage the parties to reach a voluntary settlement of the dispute, but may, after a reasonable period of mediation, as determined by the mediator, certify to the Board that the impasse continues and end mediation efforts.  (d) If the impasse remains unresolved for 15 days after the mediator's certification to the Board, either party may petition the Board to appoint an arbitrator who has been mutually agreed upon by the parties.

The Board shall decide the appropriate unit for collective bargaining in each case and the employees to be included in that unit to assure the employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this chapter.  (b) In determining whether a unit is appropriate, the extent to which the employees have organized is not controlling. The Board shall not recognize a unit if, after investigation and hearing, the Board determines that the employees do not constitute a unit appropriate for collective bargaining or if recognition of that unit will result in over-fragmentation of collective bargaining units.  (c) If an interested person files with the Board a charge alleging that employees eligible to vote in an election under this chapter were coerced or restrained in the exercise of that right, the Board shall investigate and conduct hearings into the validity of the charge.

Where reliable data enables the Department of Buildings and General Services to establish these additional environmental externalities' costs or benefits with respect to a particular purchasing decision or category of purchasing decisions, that is energy related, the Department may recommend the addition or subtraction of an additional price factor. All State agencies shall consider the price factor and environmental considerations set by the Department when examining life-cycle costs for purchasing decisions.  (2) \"State facilities,\" when used in this chapter, shall mean all State-owned or leased buildings, structures, appurtenances, and grounds.  (3) \"State fleet,\" as used in this chapter, shall mean passenger vehicles and light duty trucks for use by State employees in the conduct of official duties, excluding law enforcement vehicles assigned to sworn law enforcement officers, and shall be procured by the Commissioner of Buildings and General Services.  (b) It is the general policy of the State of Vermont:  (1) To ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that State government can meet its energy needs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a manner that is adequate, reliable, secure, and sustainable; that assures affordability and encourages the State's economic vitality, the efficient use of energy resources, and cost-effective demand side management; and that is environmentally sound.  (2) To identify and evaluate, on an ongoing basis, resources that will meet State government energy service, infrastructure, purchasing and supply, and fleet needs in accordance with the principles of least cost integrated planning; including efficiency, conservation and load management alternatives, purchasing preferences, wise use of renewable resources and environmentally sound infrastructure development, energy supply, purchasing practices, and fleet management.  (c) The Secretary of Administration with the cooperation of the Commissioners of Public Service and of Buildings and General Services shall develop and oversee the implementation of a State Agency Energy Plan for State government. The Plan shall be adopted by June 30, 2005, modified as necessary, and readopted by the Secretary on or before January 15, 2010 and each sixth year subsequent to 2010. The Plan shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Energy Plan (CEP) issued under 30 V.S.A. 202b. The Plan shall accomplish the following objectives and requirements:  (1) To conserve resources, save energy, and reduce pollution. The Plan shall devise strategies to identify to the greatest extent feasible all opportunities for conservation of resources through environmentally and economically sound infrastructure development, purchasing, and fleet management, and investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency available to the State which are cost effective on a life-cycle cost basis.  (2) To consider State policies and operations that affect energy use.  (3) To devise a strategy to implement or acquire all prudent opportunities and investments in as prompt and efficient a manner as possible.  (4) To include appropriate provisions for monitoring resource and energy use and evaluating the impact of measures undertaken.  (5) To identify education, management, and other relevant policy changes that are a part of the implementation strategy.  (6) To devise a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan shall include steps to encourage more efficient trip planning, to reduce the average fuel consumption of the State fleet, to encourage alternatives to solo-commuting State employees for commuting and job-related travel, and to incorporate conventional hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles into the State fleet if cost-effective on a life-cycle basis.  (7) To provide, where feasible, for the installation of renewable energy systems including solar energy systems, which shall include equipment or building design features, or both, designed to attain the optimal mix of minimizing solar gain in the summer and maximizing solar gain during the winter, as part of the new construction or major renovation of any State building. The cost of implementation and installation will be identified as part of the budget process presented to the General Assembly.  (d) The Department of Buildings and General Services shall coordinate State purchasing decisions, according to procedures developed by the Commissioner in cooperation with the Commissioner of Public Service, to ensure comparisons based on relative life-cycle costs.  (e) The Commissioner of Buildings and General Services shall develop life-cycle cost guidelines for use in all State buildings. These guidelines shall require all new construction and major renovations to meet or exceed the current \"Vermont Commercial Building Energy Standards.\" Where practicable, the goal shall be attaining an EPA ENERGY STAR/rs rating of at least 75.  (1) The Department of Buildings and General Services shall develop a State strategy to reduce overall energy consumption in existing and proposed State buildings based on energy consumption levels specified in the energy conservation standard referred to in this subsection. The Plan shall identify, in buildings at variance with the energy standards referred to in this subsection, the cost to bring the building into compliance, and energy cost savings for the remaining useful life of the building.  (2) Each State agency and department, designated by the Secretary of Administration, which constructs or manages State buildings shall, by June 30, 2005, assure that new construction or major renovation of such structures incorporates those practical energy efficiency measures and energy consuming systems that result in the lowest life-cycle cost. New construction of State buildings shall be highly efficient and shall employ optimal siting and design, given the uses to which the buildings are to be put, with respect to solar gain and temperature control. State buildings shall be shaded and ventilated and their air circulation managed, to the extent practical, instead of being cooled by air conditioning.  (3) In capital requests to the General Assembly, the Commissioner of Buildings and General Services shall include, when appropriate, work plans, budgets, and proposed financing mechanisms to accomplish these reductions in energy use.  (f) The Commissioner of Buildings and General Services shall biennially report to the Secretary of Administration on the State's implementation of this section. (Added 1991, No. 259 (Adj.

Wind energy generation; State lands  (a) Wind energy generation facilities can provide an important combination of environmental, energy, and economic benefits to the State. Given these benefits, and the fact that the State has allowed other types of facilities to be sited on State lands, it is reasonable to site wind energy generation facilities on State lands, including wind energy generation facilities that are of commercial scale, if such siting does not directly conflict with a specific restriction in federal or State law or with a specific restriction or covenant contained in a conveyance of an interest in the property to the State or one of its agencies or departments, and if sites for wind energy on State lands are chosen and developed in a manner that maximizes energy production and minimizes environmental and aesthetic impacts.  (b) The existing policy of the Agency, entitled \"Wind Energy and Other Renewable Energy Development on ANR Lands\" (Dec. 2004) (the existing policy) shall not bar the Agency from considering any proposal to construct a meteorological station or wind energy generation facility, including a wind energy generation facility of commercial scale, on lands that the Agency owns or controls. If the Agency receives such a proposal, the Agency shall review the proposal within a reasonably prompt period and provide the entity making the proposal with information regarding the feasibility of and potential constraints that may apply to the proposal. The Agency also shall consider the potential costs and benefits of the proposal to the State of Vermont, including any benefits or impacts that would be derived from leasing State lands to the entity making the proposal.  (c) On receipt of significant new information on the existing policy or on wind energy generation on State lands, the Agency shall undertake a review of that policy and determine if a change in the policy is warranted. During that review, the Agency shall solicit the comments and recommendations of wind energy developers, renewable energy organizations, and other potentially affected entities.

Pending the final determination of any appeal, the terms of the order involved shall be given effect by the Agency except insofar as they relate to retroactive benefits.  (g) A party to an order or decree of the Board or the Board itself, or both, may petition the Supreme Court for relief against any disobedience of or noncompliance with the order or decree. In the proceedings and upon such notice thereof to the parties as it shall direct, the Supreme Court shall hear and consider the petition and make such order and decree in the premises by way of writ of mandamus, writ of prohibition, injunction, or otherwise, concerning the enforcement of the order and decree of the Board as shall be appropriate.  (h)(1) Notwithstanding subsections (d) and (f) of this section, the Secretary shall review all Board decisions and orders concerning TANF, TANF-EA, Office of Child Support Cases, Medicaid, and the Vermont Health Benefit Exchange. The Secretary shall:  (A) adopt a Board decision or order, except that the Secretary may reverse or modify a Board decision or order if:  (i) the Board's findings of fact lack any support in the record; or  (ii) the decision or order misinterprets or misapplies State or federal policy or rule; and  (B) issue a written decision setting forth the legal, factual, or policy basis for reversing or modifying a Board decision or order.

(3) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, only the claimant may appeal a decision of the Secretary to the Supreme Court. Such appeals shall be pursuant to V.R.A.P. 13. The Supreme Court may stay the Secretary's decision upon the claimant's showing of a fair ground for litigation on the merits. The Supreme Court shall not stay the Secretary's order insofar as it relates to a denial of retroactive benefits.  (i) In the case of an appeal of a Medicaid covered service decision made by the Department of Vermont Health Access or any entity with which the Department of Vermont Health Access enters into an agreement to perform service authorizations that may result in an adverse benefit determination, the right to a fair hearing granted by subsection (a) of this section shall be available to an aggrieved beneficiary only after that individual has exhausted, or is deemed to have exhausted, the Department of Vermont Health Access's internal appeals process and has received a notice that the adverse benefit determination was upheld.
